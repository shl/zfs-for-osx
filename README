To preserve this part of history – and maybe to fork 
around? – I’ve created a clone of the original repository 
As far as I see, there should be no legal issues, but if 
you know more than me, just drop me a line.

I don’t plan to continue this project, I don’t plan to 
release new versions of anything. And I’m not fixing it 
to work with 10.6. You don’t want me to do that – I’m a 
horrible programmer! 

Have a look at 
 * http://groups.google.com/group/zfs-macos
 * https://github.com/dustin/mac-zfs/
 * https://github.com/shl/zfs-for-osx/
for a version that runs on 10.6
