<PRE>Me again...

After adding three more disks to my RAID.Z Pool (now 2x 3 disks) I  
issued a scrub just to be sure everything is fine.

Well, apparently it isn't, since zpool tells me I have chksum errors  
(85% done, 5 errors so far) on one of the additional disks (which  
isn't new and the smallest of all: old 3x 750GB, new 500/200/120GB).  
That same disk worked fine as a standalone ZFS device until yesterday,  
with scrubs without any error messages.

After searching the web and the opensolaris zfs-discuss mailinglist  
for quite some time, I discovered that there are/were a few bugs  
related to false chksum error messages during scrub, especially with  
high activity Pools and lots of unfinished scrubs (this is my... ~10th  
attempt on this Pool due to snapshots interrupting).

What is the status of &quot;our&quot; ZFS for OS X? Any known bugs regarding  
false chksum error messages? I would love to make additional tests,  
with zdb for example, but I think that's not available for OS X yet,  
is it?

It wouldn't be that big an issue to exchange this disk with another,  
possibly bigger one, but is it necessary?

Thank you.


Best regards,

Christian
