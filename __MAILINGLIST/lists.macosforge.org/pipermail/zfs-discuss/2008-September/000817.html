&gt;<i> Harald, thanks for the idea, but I don't have any zfs tools
</I>&gt;<i> available from single user mode.
</I>
Why not? I suppose it's possible you need to load the zfs extension
(using kextload), and you may need to run  mount -uw /  in case the
zpool and/or zfs programs need write access to /etc/zfs/ to work
right, but other than that I see no problem there.  But I haven't
tried it myself, and would very much like to know what could go wrong
with it.

(My other idea is more complicated, namely to disable the automounter
using  sudo launchtcl unload -w com.apple.automountd  and then
rebooting.  This might inhibit the mounting of your zfs volumes and
allow you to change them.  Unfortunately, it might inhibit the
mounting of other critical volumes as well, and so just compound the
problem.  So I wouldn't recommend this unless you really have a firm
grasp of what you're doing.)

- Harald
