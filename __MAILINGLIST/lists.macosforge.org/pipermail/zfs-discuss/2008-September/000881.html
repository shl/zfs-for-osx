<PRE>&gt;<i> and again me...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Known problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> iTunes 8 (and before that, 7 as well) seems to have some problems with
</I>&gt;<i> finding specific songs on my external ZFS volume (mounted on /Volumes/
</I>&gt;<i> music.hessi) with a filesystem iTunes on it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> galahad:~ hessi$ zfs list
</I>&gt;<i> NAME                                USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
</I>&gt;<i> music.hessi                         122G  23,7G  21,2G  /Volumes/
</I>&gt;<i> music.hessi
</I>&gt;<i> music.hessi/iTunes                  101G  23,7G  99,3G  /Volumes/
</I>&gt;<i> music.hessi/iTunes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Surprisingly, it only occurs with (apparently random) files in these
</I>&gt;<i> three directories:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /Volumes/music.hessi/iTunes/iTunes.hessi/iTunes Music/My Chemical
</I>&gt;<i> Romance/Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge/
</I>&gt;<i> /Volumes/music.hessi/iTunes/iTunes.hessi/iTunes Music/Wir sind Helden/
</I>&gt;<i> Die Reklamation/
</I>&gt;<i> /Volumes/music.hessi/iTunes/iTunes.hessi/iTunes Music/Tegan And Sara/
</I>&gt;<i> So Jealous/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All filenames have a space between track number and title, some of
</I>&gt;<i> them have special characters:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 08 Interlude.m4a
</I>&gt;<i> 05 I'm Not Okay (I Promise).m4p
</I>&gt;<i> 10 M&#252;ssen nur wollen.m4a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are 2829 Directories/Artists in /Volumes/music.hessi/iTunes/
</I>&gt;<i> iTunes.hessi/iTunes Music/, a lot of them with similar length (if not
</I>&gt;<i> longer) and spaces as well as special characters like above in their
</I>&gt;<i> paths and filenames. Still, during the last couple of months, it only
</I>&gt;<i> occurred in these three directories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After manually pointing iTunes to the right file, it finds and plays
</I>&gt;<i> it, even between reboots, exports and imports of the pool. The error
</I>&gt;<i> occurs about once a week, each time with a different file (in one of
</I>&gt;<i> these directories).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any hint on what's going on? Can I be of any more assistance?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Christian

</I>I have seen this problem myself and I believe I know the source of the  
problem. The good news is that once you have all instances fixed, it  
stays fixed. The other good news is that if you start with ZFS it  
doesn't affect you. The bad news is that almost all of us started with  
HFS+ and migrated our iTunes Library to ZFS.

One of the (few) really nice things about iTunes is the library  
management. Editing a song title, album name, or artist name in the  
library not only updates the tags, but renames the file and/or folder  
it is in. iTunes stores the complete list of files in an XML document  
so it doesn't have to walk the folder tree every time its opened. As  
long as you always manage the library though iTunes, the XML library  
file should always be in sync with the music files in the library.  
However, the definition of in-sync depends on the underlying filesystem.

With HFS+, the file system is case preserving, but not case sensitive.  
So, if you rename a file such that only the case has changed, you can  
still open it with the old name. With ZFS, which is truly case  
sensitive, the attempt to open with the old name, differing only by  
case, fails. When you have your iTunes library on an HFS+ drive and  
you edit a song attribute that affects full file path (artist name,  
album title or song title) but only by changing the case, the XML  
library file reflects the change but the file is not actually renamed.  
That is fairly harmless, though not technically correct, as long as  
your files are still on the HFS+ volume. However, when you migrate  
your library to a ZFS volume, and the case does matter, these files  
are suddenly inaccessible. Worse, since iTunes doesn't actually try to  
open a file until you want to play it or edit the tags, you don't  
immediately know which are affected when the library is initially  
migrated.

The workaround, as you've found, is to re-point iTunes to the very  
same file, forcing it to update its filename in the XML library file.  
This then makes the filename consistent between library and on-disk.  
Whenever I bumped into one of these, I would simply reprocess the  
entire album knowing that chances are it affects the whole thing. The  
proper fix is to fix iTunes so that it actually renames the file  
rather than taking the shortcut and assuming it will still be  
accessible with the case difference.

This is actually an issue for the iTunes team rather than the ZFS  
team, but perhaps No&#235;l can go kick the right people in the butt and  
get this resolved. There are a lot more bugs in iTunes which are more  
severe, but they remain unfixed across major versions despite feedback  
sent through the iTunes feedback mechanism. So, I wouldn't expect much  
action on this bug without pressure from within Apple. The iTunes team  
is much more focused on adding yet more flashy trash 'features' than  
making the basic operations function properly. For example, if you are  
in album shuffle, and two bands have albums by the same name, iTunes  
can't play either as an album because it gets confused as it considers  
only the album tag rather than a combination of artist and album tag.  
If you have a large library, this particular bug comes up very easily.  
The real fix would actually involve looking as track and disc tags as  
well since some bands have albums and singles of the same name, which  
also get mixed up. Though, the most bizarre omission with album  
shuffle is the fact that party shuffle, the only mode that allows you  
to see what's next in the random play, ignores the setting and still  
picks individual songs, even though every other aspect of iTunes  
respects the setting including smart playlists set to randomly select  
on certain criteria.
