<PRE>Mac ZFS Community,

We recently (days ago) migrated two users' entire home directories to a
ZFS formatted internal drives (mirrored, entire slice both disks). This
was after using ZFS for Final Cut for many months without any problems. 

Currently, when attempting to mount our own iDisk to view contents or 
copy a file to or from the iDisk, the Finder freezes---sort of. The copy
to or from iDisk does not work, it says that it is copying, but actually
never completes the process, a file of the same name and 0 bytes shows
up on the iDisk. iDisk sync is off, because I thought this was the
problem two days ago.

Meanwhile, the Finder allows one to open applications, click through
windows and open files, but will not update any new files on the
computer. For example, if you save a new file to the Desktop, the
Finder will not show you the file, even though it exists in
Terminal (and in Finder upon reboot). 

Additionally, you cannot copy anything from a mounted disk (dmg, USB) to
anywhere on the computer, ZFS or HFS+ formatted disks, until the
Finder restarts (restarting the computer).

Logout does not work in these cases either, I have to do a manual
reboot from Terminal. I haven't tried to specifically kill Finder, as I
am not clear on how to do that in Mac.

Has anyone experienced anything vaguely similar? Is this an iDisk issue
or does the iDisk/Finder combination have problems with ZFS? That said,
cadaver does not have issues with ZFS and iDisk connections, as I can
copy files to and from our iDisk using Solaris (on ZFS). In my
experience, the Finder/iDisk combination has been unusable on Mac in
the past, perhaps this is just a continuation of the same.

Thanks for any ideas.
