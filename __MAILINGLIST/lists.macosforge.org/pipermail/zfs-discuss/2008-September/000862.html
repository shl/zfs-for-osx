<PRE>Hi All,

I'm using Mac OS Forge's ZFS on several disks over iSCSI and I am  
quite impressed so far.  The performance is fantastic. rsync of very  
large files/directories claims transfer rates in the &gt;80MB/s range.  
Xbench numbers are so good they are suspicious.  Performance is much,  
much better than when Open Solaris 2008.05 &quot;owned&quot; the disks and made  
them an iSCSI target, albeit that was running in VMware Server 2.0 RC2  
which may have poor networking, etc.  The Getting Started docs are  
very good and enough to quickly get up and running.

I have a few questions:
1. Is there a &quot;mission statement&quot; or something that indicates what is  
planned for this implementation of ZFS?
2. How stable is this ZFS implementation?  Can I trust it with  
important stuff?
3. Will support/development be ongoing?  Is it a goal that the  
transition to an official Apple release of ZFS (Snow Leopard?) be  
possible?
4. Do Apple OS updates/patches present a problem?

For the curious, the server is a PC running CentOS 5.2.  iscsitarget v. 
0.4.16 is in charge of the disks which are presented as a single  
target (multiple LUNs) in blockio mode.  The client is a Mac Mini  
(Intel) runing Leopard v10.5.5.  The iSCSI initiator is Studio Network  
Solution's free globalSan v3.3.0.43.  The network is running at 1  
gigabit.

		Thanks for ZFS on the Mac!!
		Rich
</PRE>
