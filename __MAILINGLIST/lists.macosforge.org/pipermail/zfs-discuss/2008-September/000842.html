<PRE>Jason is correct below.  We added copies for people that were  
restricted to only being able to run one drive, so if you've got some  
really important data but only one drive (travelling with a laptop?),  
we'll space these copies out on the disk as much as we can since most  
drive failures are partial drive failures.  Then you're odds are  
greater then you are able to recover the file(s) either saving the  
disk yourself or using a salvage program such as Disk Warrior.

</I>&gt;<i> failure... at least in the test I did this evening, your data will be

</I>&gt;<i> prevent further damage. There really just isn't any guarantee that
</I>&gt;<i> your data can survive a hard disk failure except when using mirroring
</I>&gt;<i> or raidz. The copies option seems best suited to handle cases where a
</I>&gt;<i> single drive might have read/write failures, but if the drive is
</I>&gt;<i> pulled out of the system or dies completely, I don't expect the copies
</I>&gt;<i> option to help you out at all. You might be able to get this to work,
</I>&gt;<i> but as far as I've ever seen, this is not a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could be wrong in what i've said so far, but here is the basic
</I>&gt;<i> point... it's a very bad idea if this is any sort of data you care
</I>&gt;<i> about. What I've defined as non-critical data in the past always turns
</I>&gt;<i> out to be more critical later on down the road. Maybe that is just  
</I>&gt;<i> me...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my recommendation, not knowing much more about your situation.
</I>&gt;<i> Use two drives of about equal size, mirror them and start your pool
</I>&gt;<i> with those two drives. Now if you need more storage you can either add
</I>&gt;<i> more drives, two at a time, mirroring each and adding it to the pool.
</I>&gt;<i> When you can't add more sets of drives, replace the single smallest
</I>&gt;<i> drive with a larger one and resilver. Once the resilver is complete,
</I>&gt;<i> replace the second drive in that same mirror set with a larger drive
</I>&gt;<i> and resilver again. Upon completion your pool will resize as it now
</I>&gt;<i> realizes there is more space available in that mirror set. Usually you
</I>&gt;<i> want to add more mirror sets before replacing smaller drives, but that
</I>&gt;<i> is of course your call based upon your circumstances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is what I am running now, I used to run raidz, but have found a
</I>&gt;<i> set of three two-way mirrors provide me with better data security.
</I>&gt;<i> If luck is on my side I could even have up to three drives fail (one
</I>&gt;<i> drive out of each mirror) and not suffer any data loss.
</I>&gt;<i>
