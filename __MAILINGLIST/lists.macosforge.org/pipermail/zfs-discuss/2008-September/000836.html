<PRE>Just to follow up on this idea of using copies=2 instead of mirroring.

I just did a small test using local files using the exact scenario you  
suggested and in my opinion, this is a very, very bad idea.

If you have parts of one drive that fail, maybe, just maybe you will  
be lucky and recover what you need, but if you have a complete drive  
failure... at least in the test I did this evening, your data will be  
gone. ZFS will treat it as a severe failure and will halt the OS to  
prevent further damage. There really just isn't any guarantee that  
your data can survive a hard disk failure except when using mirroring  
or raidz. The copies option seems best suited to handle cases where a  
single drive might have read/write failures, but if the drive is  
pulled out of the system or dies completely, I don't expect the copies  
option to help you out at all. You might be able to get this to work,  
but as far as I've ever seen, this is not a good idea.

I could be wrong in what i've said so far, but here is the basic  
point... it's a very bad idea if this is any sort of data you care  
about. What I've defined as non-critical data in the past always turns  
out to be more critical later on down the road. Maybe that is just me...

Here is my recommendation, not knowing much more about your situation.
Use two drives of about equal size, mirror them and start your pool  
with those two drives. Now if you need more storage you can either add  
more drives, two at a time, mirroring each and adding it to the pool.  
When you can't add more sets of drives, replace the single smallest  
drive with a larger one and resilver. Once the resilver is complete,  
replace the second drive in that same mirror set with a larger drive  
and resilver again. Upon completion your pool will resize as it now  
realizes there is more space available in that mirror set. Usually you  
want to add more mirror sets before replacing smaller drives, but that  
is of course your call based upon your circumstances.

This is what I am running now, I used to run raidz, but have found a  
set of three two-way mirrors provide me with better data security.
If luck is on my side I could even have up to three drives fail (one  
drive out of each mirror) and not suffer any data loss.
