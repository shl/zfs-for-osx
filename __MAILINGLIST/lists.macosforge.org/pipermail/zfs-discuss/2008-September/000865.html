We have been using it for video editing with Final Cut for a few months
now and haven't experienced difficulty with it. We have just moved the
user partitions to ZFS and will see how that goes. The problems are as
above, mainly that the Finder cannot come up with a name other than the
pool name. This results in the poolname being displayed in the Finder
sidebar rather than the username and can be confusing. To get around
this, we mounted the zfs datasets that are shared (Music, Pictures,
FC work) under /Users/Shared. We then placed a 'Shared' icon in the
Finder sidebar and clicking on this allows one to find the ZFS datasets
under Shared with their proper names. Additionally, we have a problem
where the zpool is not mounted upon reboot and requires a manual 'import
-f' to be done, so one user has to be on the boot disk without zfs and
automatic login must be turned off. I find this to be the most annoying
problem, the others can be worked around even by those who are
unfamiliar with CL.
