&gt;<i> Is it possible to mirror a raidz or striped pool to a single device

No.  It's antithetical to the ZFS Way.  However, it can be forced with
the -f option.

&gt;<i> Is it better to replicate the original pool to a separate pool?  If so, what
</I>&gt;<i> is the best way?  Snapshots and send/recv are still a little taboo for me
</I>&gt;<i> :-/
</I>
If you're not ready for snapshots, get ready.  If it's impossible for
you to embrace them, use rsync.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to pickup a 1TB drive and increase my storage space and
</I>&gt;<i> redundancy by:
</I>&gt;<i> a. converting the raidz pool to a striped pool and mirror it onto the 1TB
</I>&gt;<i> drive (3x320 stripe + 1TB mirror of the stripe)
</I>
Do you mean create a mirror vdev out of the 3x320 + 1TB drives?  See
comment above about -f. Again, it goes against the grain, but you can
force it.  Split the 1TB drive in to 3 partitions equal in size to
your 320 GB drives and create a mirror vdev out of the six &quot;disks&quot;.

&gt;<i> b. Keep the raidz pool as is and do replication of that pool onto the 1TB
</I>&gt;<i> drive as a separate 1 drive zfs &quot;pool&quot;
</I>
Sure, this works. Use rsync or better yet snapshot.

&gt;<i> c. Go crazy and use NexentaSTOR on a VM to export the storage with iSCSI and
</I>&gt;<i> have a real HFS+ volume on the Mac (I actually did this, but performance is
</I>&gt;<i> abysmal.  Average of 5MB/s writes and peaks at about 20MB/s.  Reads are no
</I>&gt;<i> faster.)
</I>
I do something similar to this using Linux as the iSCSI target/server
with the GlobalSAN iSCSI Mac OS X initiator.  Group together the
various LUNs and create a single target out of it.  Let ZFS on the Mac
create the vdevs.  It works for me.  I see my Gb network saturate when
transferring large files.  No stability issues.  I ended up using real
hardware because the VM approach for Solaris 10 and Linux was slow, as
you observed.  (I also tried Mac OS X's software RAID &amp; HFS+ and was
impressed by the performance.)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since snapshots aren't fully baked in OS X yet, I think the easiest thing
</I>&gt;<i> would be option a.  (Feedback welcome! I haven't played with snapshots yet)
</I>&gt;<i> but I can't figure how to do a mirror of a stripe.
</I>
I think you mean a simple volume, not a stripped volume.  Most vdevs
are (dynamically) stripped (raidz is stripped, more than one mirror
vdev is stripped, ...).

I think the cake will be fully baked Real Soon Now.  It seems like the
ZFS team has to provide a significant update for Snow Leopard some
time soon.  Don't invest too much in to your alternative solution
because ZFS will fully support snapshots before you know it (Feb?).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also considering buying another small SATA drive for OS X so I would
</I>&gt;<i> have 4x 320GB for a raidz pool.
</I>
Best idea yet.  Consider creating a mirror out of them.  You'll get
better IOPS and can easily add disk to the pool (unlike raidz).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically my question is: what is a good, simple backup or replication plan
</I>&gt;<i> for this scenario?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
