<PRE>Hi List!

Im on my new MacBook Pro now and while i have a bunch of hds which i  
could connect via FW800 to it i would like to have the flexibility to  
go with my shiny book wherever i want in my house and have all the hds  
in a ZFS-related Server, so, maybe OSolaris in it's newest Version.

I think this could be the way to go for the time being as long as zfs  
on mac os isn't finally mature.

So the question is: is there anyone on the list who considered this or  
have already an OS-server running in his home? Any recommendations or  
links for that?

What i would like to do is to serve my media-library (musik, films,  
learning media, etc.) from that server with 5 or max. 8 HDs as raidz.  
Also i would like to use it for Apache, RoR and Webapplication related  
work, it would be great if there was a way to remote-administer the  
server from my macbook in an timbuktu-like style way...

Any takers on this?


Thanks, and sorry for the off-topicness of this mail,



Bernd
