<PRE>Hi All,

I've totally fallen in love with ZFS.  I started on OpenSolaris and have
migrated to using it on OS X.  As we all have seen things aren't quite there
yet with OS X / Finder integration and there are definitely bugs with
interaction with DiskUtility.

Anyway, I am trying to figure out the best way to backup or replicate (yes,
I know the difference) my storage pool. I have 4x 320GB Seagate 7200.10
drives.  I also have 3x  Seagate 250 GB USB drives.  These have given me
nothing but headache and won't stay connected, so they have been deemed
unreliable for ZFS (sigh - I was hoping to use these as a backup for the
main pool.)

Is it possible to mirror a raidz or striped pool to a single device
effectively?
Is it better to replicate the original pool to a separate pool?  If so, what
is the best way?  Snapshots and send/recv are still a little taboo for me
:<i>-/
</I>
I would like to pickup a 1TB drive and increase my storage space and
redundancy by:
a. converting the raidz pool to a striped pool and mirror it onto the 1TB
drive (3x320 stripe + 1TB mirror of the stripe)
b. Keep the raidz pool as is and do replication of that pool onto the 1TB
drive as a separate 1 drive zfs &quot;pool&quot;
c. Go crazy and use NexentaSTOR on a VM to export the storage with iSCSI and
have a real HFS+ volume on the Mac (I actually did this, but performance is
abysmal.  Average of 5MB/s writes and peaks at about 20MB/s.  Reads are no
faster.)

Since snapshots aren't fully baked in OS X yet, I think the easiest thing
would be option a.  (Feedback welcome! I haven't played with snapshots yet)
but I can't figure how to do a mirror of a stripe.

I'm also considering buying another small SATA drive for OS X so I would
have 4x 320GB for a raidz pool.

Basically my question is: what is a good, simple backup or replication plan
for this scenario?

Thoughts?
Aaron
