<PRE>Uh oh, it's my turn to ask for help/advice.  First, I want to say I
have not lost any data, so no worries there.  But, my zfs pool is on a
set of external firewire drives and I've had ongoing problems with bad
capacitors taking out the power supplies on them.  I fix them when
that happens and resilver and all is well since I'm running as raidz1.
 Recently I added a hot spare on the idea that it would automatically
spring in to action a replace a failed drive.  But it didn't.  Here's
what things looked like:

$ zpool status
  pool: Storage
 state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices could not be used because the label is missing or
	invalid.  Sufficient replicas exist for the pool to continue
	functioning in a degraded state.
action: Replace the device using 'zpool replace'.
   see: <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-4J">http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-4J</A>
 scrub: none requested
config:

	NAME                    STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
	Storage                 DEGRADED     0     0     0
	  raidz1                DEGRADED     0     0     0
	    disk7s2             ONLINE       0     0     0
	    disk6s2             ONLINE       0     0     0
	    699198789361538667  FAULTED      0     0     0  was /dev/disk6s2
	    disk4s2             ONLINE       0     0     0
	    disk3s2             ONLINE       0     0     0
	    disk2s2             ONLINE       0     0     0
	spares
	  disk1s2               AVAIL

errors: No known data errors

So my questions are as follows:

1) Why didn't the hot spare automatically fill in for the faulted
disk?  Isn't that what they're for?

2) I know you can't grow a raidz, but can you add a disk to convert a
raidz1 to raidz2?

3) While the disk was in a quazi-weird state (that's a technical
term!) I couldn't run zpool status without locking up.  I guessed at
what was happening and tracked down the back drive.  Only when it was
powered off could I run zpool status successfully.  Others have seen
similar issues, as I recall.  Has this been fixed yet?  Any ETA on new
bits?

Thank you!
</PRE>
