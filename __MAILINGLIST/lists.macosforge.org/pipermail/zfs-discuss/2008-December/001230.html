<PRE>I have been unable to create snapshots since October. Until today.

I exported the raidz1 pool, then I tried to boot my Mac Pro with the
OpenSolaris 2008.11 CD. didn't work, got stuck on an unrecognized UART
value at 0x3f8 (I think).

But did you know that VMWare Fusion can see non-Windows disks? I created
VMWare &quot;raw&quot; disks for each device in the pool, then added them to an
OpenSolaris virtual machine. Before I started the virtual machine, I made
*sure* that my pool was exported (zpool export) and unmounted. Started it
up. It worked.

I got different complaints from OpenSolaris, which helped me troubleshoot
my problem. I have ZFS filesystems nested under other, top-level ZFS
filesystems. Fine. BUT the mountpoint directories for those
sub-filesystems were not empty. &quot;zpool import&quot; on OpenSolaris complained
about that; I don't think zpool on Mac OS X said anything about it.

If the mountpoint of a ZFS filesystem isn't empty, and is a directory on
another ZFS filesystem, then everything will work rock-solid UNTIL you try
to create a snapshot. The snapshot will fail with a completely cryptic
&quot;dataset is busy&quot; message.


Once I figured that out, I simply mounted my filesystems elsewhere,
snapshot no problem.
Also I could see the offending files: usually an empty &quot;.automounted&quot;
file. My home-dir mountpoint had a new user template (e.g., the &quot;About
Stacks.PDF&quot; in the Documents folder).

I cleared up some of that inside the OpenSolaris VM, unmounted everything,
another zpool export, shut down the VM. It seemed to get stuck shutting
down. I waited a bit then turned it off from vmware.

On a Mac OS X Terminal, I did a zpool import and zpool status...

Oops. My raidz1 is degraded, somehow it's looking for the BSD-style
&quot;dsk/c0t0s3p1&quot; instead of &quot;/dev/disk3s2&quot;. For the last element; an
off-by-1 bug? Anyway, I did a &quot;zpool replace&quot; to explain that to the
system. Now it's resilvering, 5 hours to go.



So yeah, this is insanely dangerous, perhaps. But if you want to examine a
ZFS setup on OpenSolaris, you can use VMWare running on the Mac!

I will post the detailed commands I used to set up the VM when I get back
to a working computer. I'm typing all this on my iPhone, sorry. The
auto-correction is driving me crazy...
