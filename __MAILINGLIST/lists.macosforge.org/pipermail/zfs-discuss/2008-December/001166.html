<PRE>&gt;<i> 1) Why didn't the hot spare automatically fill in for the faulted
</I>&gt;<i> disk?  Isn't that what they're for?
</I>
Eek, my fault for not advertising this issue better since I didn't  
think anyone was using it.  Hot spares don't currently work because  
there is no disk ioctl notification in OSX to tell me that a disk has  
died/disappeard/gone AWOL.  There is notification for disks via IOkit  
and the iokit layer.  But to play in that sandbox you need to be an  
iokit kext.  We've recently just finished converting zfs into an IOkit  
kext, however because if changes on both our side and kernel, these  
bits will not work on Leopard.  It has to be the new release, hence if  
you're on the Seed program you'll get it soon, otherwise you will have  
to wait till Snow Leopard gets released.

&gt;<i> 2) I know you can't grow a raidz, but can you add a disk to convert a
</I>&gt;<i> raidz1 to raidz2?
</I>
Nope, this isn't possible either.  This migration also would require  
rewriting lots of block pointers which gets messy.  Sun is working on  
getting block pointer rewrite to work, but it's not ready yet last I'd  
checked.

&gt;<i> 3) While the disk was in a quazi-weird state (that's a technical
</I>&gt;<i> term!) I couldn't run zpool status without locking up.  I guessed at
</I>&gt;<i> what was happening and tracked down the back drive.  Only when it was
</I>&gt;<i> powered off could I run zpool status successfully.  Others have seen
</I>&gt;<i> similar issues, as I recall.  Has this been fixed yet?  Any ETA on new
</I>&gt;<i> bits?
</I>
This issue should be fixed in the new IOkit bits, now that we get  
actual disk status. (p.s. I like your new technical term :)  )
