<PRE>Hallo everyone

First, I'm not yet subscribed to the list, please include my address  
in the reply, thanks a lot.

I've recently started using ZFS (zfs-119) on my MacPro. It all worked  
fine, ignoring all the open issues that are still work in progress.
Looking at the source makes me wonder if there will be additionall  
releases before the inclusion in MacOS 10.6.

Since Apple published the source, there have been very little changes  
to the source, so I'd like to ask if it's better to wait for 10.6  
before actively converting my existing filesystems. The last change  
seems to be 5 month ago.

Does anyone have any information wether Apple will continue publishing  
changes here, or is all the development on ZFS targetting the next OSX  
release and will only be included in upcoming seeds for Snow Leopard?

Don't get me wrong. I'm just wondering if it's better to wait for  
official releases, because there's little visible activity with  
regards to the cdebase.

Thanks, and have a Happy New Year
Patrick
