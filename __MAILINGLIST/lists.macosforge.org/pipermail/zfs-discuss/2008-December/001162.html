<PRE>I run a mac mini with 4g of ram (only 3 usable) and it acts as a hub,  
fileserver, mail server etc. with FireWire drives. The Mac can handle  
it - before I was running the lot on a  450Mhz Cube with osx server.  
The configuration of the system is really the only bit that you have  
to get used to - OpenSolaris is different from Mac which is different  
from Linux.

I'd say the NFSv4 support is only available in Solaris, but NFSv3 is  
OK in Mac; but the zfs share is missing in Mac and won't be there for  
a while - that's about the only downside to the Mac solution.

Unless you have money to burn, I wouldn't bother getting OSX Server.  
Yes, it makes some things easy but it also makes the average things  
difficult and pretty undocumented. Most unix packages can be  
recompiled for OSX anyway.
