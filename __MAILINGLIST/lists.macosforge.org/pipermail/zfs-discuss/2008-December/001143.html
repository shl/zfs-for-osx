<PRE>StoreGPU: Exploiting Graphics Processing Units to Accelerate 
Distributed Storage Systems

Today GPUs are a largely under exploited resource on existing 
desktops and a possible cost-effective enhancement to 
high-performance systems. To date, most applications that exploit 
GPUs are specialized scientific applications. Little attention has 
been paid to harnessing these highly-parallel devices to support more 
generic functionality at the operating system or middleware level. 
This study starts from the hypothesis that generic middleware level 
techniques that improve distributed system reliability or performance 
(such as content addressing, erasure coding, or data similarity 
detection) can be significantly accelerated using GPU support.

We take a first step towards validating this hypothesis, focusing on 
distributed storage systems. As a proof of concept, we design 
StoreGPU, a library that accelerates a number of hashing based 
primitives popular in distributed storage system implementations. Our 
evaluation shows that StoreGPU enables up to ten fold performance 
gains on synthetic benchmarks and up to nine-fold gains for a 
high-level application, online similarity detection between large 
data files.

I cam across this and thought that I would toss it out where the 
people who write this can see it. I assume that the grand central 
thing to allow people to use the gpu more effectively will be coming 
along. I also assume that most of the time the gpu will sit largely 
unutilized, especially on large file servers. This proof of concept 
shows how you can use a relatively cheap and uncontested resource to 
accelerate some of the hashing that needs to be done. I don't know if 
their source implements the hash that zfs uses, but that does not 
mean that it can't be done. I was thinking that this could cheapen 
performing a scrub.
