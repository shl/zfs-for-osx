<PRE>So, I'm interested in playing around with ZFS a little, since I've got
2 macs running leopard.  My question is related to doing automatic
backups?

When reading the FAQ, I noticed the &quot;Unplugging my USB drive with my
ZFS pool on it causes a panic&quot; question, and saw the comment about
this being the case unless a volume is mirror or raidz.  Now, I
understand that this is mainly designed for dealing with swapping
drives out under failure conditions, but it go me thinking about
another possibility.  Could one take say take a directory on a laptop
and have that be a zfs volume that is based off of a partition on the
internal drive and a partition on an external USB drive and basically
plug into that drive whenever it is physically available to do a
backup, and then most other times when untethered only use the
internal partition?  With a typical raid situation this, would require
a full sync to take place on re-attaching the drive, but I was
wondering if ZFS might handle this differently?  Also, I assume that
the external drive could be used by itself as a recovery source if the
internal drive blows up and requires replacement.

Is this a bad idea, should I just use zfs send if I want backup?  If
the proposed idea isn't a bad idea, is there a command which should be
executed prior to disconnecting the external drive to keep the state
on there slightly more sane or known?
