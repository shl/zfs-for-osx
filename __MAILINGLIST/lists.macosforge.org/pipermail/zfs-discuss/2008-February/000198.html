As far as I can tell and as far as the support seems to be going, is  
that any file that is a normal file, like something that works under  
Linux or Sun (or can be copied from there and back to Os X and still  
work) is good to be stored on ZFS. So for example you .plist files (as  
far as I know they are just some sort of binary xml files) can be  
safely hosted on a zfs volume. The files in the Caches directory  
probably can't. Anything that has Icons will maybe loose them as well.  
In any case everything that relies on resource forks will have a  
problem because, as far as I know, zfs does not yet support them.

On the other Hand, some software seems to fix that kinds of problems  
(recent Itunes update is said to be working good on zfs, haven't tried  
yet... , EyeTV 3.0.1 seems now to work correctly from zfs volumes as  
well... )

Probably it would be a good idea to compose a list of files and  
programms that are known to work with zfs and which don't.... would be  
nice to collect them in some kind of wiki, wouldn't it?

Martin
