The hardware RAID would give you system-transparent hot-swap. But  
yeah, otherwise it's just a level of complexity that might be better  
incorporated into the ZFS stack. So I'd use it in JBOD mode, but you'd  
have to manage failed drives somehow (not certain about hot-swap). I'm  
not familiar with the VTrak (I mean, I've read about them, but don't  
have one).

Read this:

It may help you understand how to best trade off performance and raidz  
overhead when you've got ~12-48 disks to play with.

I'm not sure about &quot;tuning&quot; the file system for performance on lots of  
little files. I've played with such systems using reiserfs and NTFS;  
don't most file systems coalesce small files into the directory tree?  
With ZFS I have no idea...
