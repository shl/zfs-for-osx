</I>Oh, that's rather odd. Thanks for the info anyway.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you compared the versions of the Solaris and the Os X zfs

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Well, I hadn't really looked into it that far after mounting of the  
newly created zfs filesystems on the solaris box failed. I wrote a  
quick script to do a sort of 'zfs send -r' -- ie to send all snapshots  
which don't exist on the destination but do on the source. It worked  
fine, but the fs didn't then mount.

On the solaris box I have:-

	Sun Microsystems Inc. SunOS 5.11 snv_50 October 2007
	...
	This system is currently running ZFS version 3.

I've downloaded the latest solaris on DVD, but haven't got around to  
installing it yet, partly because that machine has no DVD drive. I'm  
hoping it'll boot and install from an external USB one.

On OS X I haven't upgraded the pool, so I'm still getting the message  
about 'zpool upgrade' in 'zpool status'. That's version 6 isn't it?
