<PRE>No. The copy from and to are both local. Copying from internal HFS+
formatted SATA drive to an externally connected USB zpool. Both mounted
in the finder. Really, just drag and drop. Can't get much simpler,
right?  ; )

Are you by chance accessing these over afp?  I've seen that behavior on
zfs shared over afp a lot, particularly with folders.

	I've been having problems while trying to do simple finder
copies from, (not limited to)  ~/Music to filesystem (
zdata/home/chris/Music ). I get an error indicating that the file is in
use. The files have not even been recently opened and I've tried to
insure that the system isn't generating a preview pane (column view),
but I still see the error quite often. Copy gets aborted at that time.
Any ideas?

	 

	1.6Ghz G5, 10.5.2, zfs vs 6, mirrored raid via USB
