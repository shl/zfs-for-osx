<PRE>That's actually exactly what I was looking for, but it seems that it's  
still not terribly stable.  I'm guessing that it's the behavior of the  
sparse image bundle file that could be impacting it, although I have  
some of the same erratic issues with &quot;Finishing backup&quot; performance on  
any network TM setup so both of them could be contributing to the issue.

I guess I should wait and see just how Time Machine behaves under  
10.5.2 when it hits.

On the ZFS front, I was just thinking that the perfect place for Apple  
to deploy this would be embedded on the NAS functionality of the  
Airport Extreme.  You have a limited number of cases from a UI  
standpoint as compared to the desktop.   Although what I'd really like  
to see is a Drobo-like implementation that the average user just plugs  
in a drive and it auto configures itself for the maximum available  
space with whatever RAID in can build and then you declare volumes to  
share.

But one thing at a time. :-)
