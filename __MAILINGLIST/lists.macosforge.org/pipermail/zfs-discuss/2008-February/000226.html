<PRE>I have a quick question regarding mounting one pool within another.  I
have made my home directory a subset of a pool called Aquarium
(Aquarium/jsnyder), and I've also made another pool that I'm mirroring
with an external drive called Puddle, within which I have my Documents
folder, which I mount at /Users/jsnyder/Documents.  This worked OK the
first time I attempted it, but during subsequent situations, I seem to
be getting maybe the Documents fs mounted first and then the jsnyder
fs mounted later leaving me with an empty documents dir and no access
to what's on Puddle/Documents.  Is there some way to set the order in
which the filesystems are mounted or to handle this differently?  I
want my Documents dir mirrored, but not the rest, which I just backup.

Any Ideas?

Thanks!
