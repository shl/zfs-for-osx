There are a couple of different factors when you're talking about  
filesystem performance in that kind of context, some of which you may  
be able to optimise with a filesystem, others not. Usually having  
large amounts of files in the same directory, irrespective of file  
size, comes down to the problem with how the directory structures are  
maintained on-disk, what the locking structure looks like, and how  
this interacts with your access pattern. I'd offer that in most such  
cases, the answer that's going to &quot;just work&quot;, irrespective of access  
pattern, is to decompose the one large directory into several layers  
of m-trees (e.g. instead of my mailbox being named mail/bayard, call  
it mail/b/ba/bayard). This is particularly effective if the file names  
are relatively static, but rename() operations within the same  
filesystem should not penalise distributing those operations against  
multiple directories (because this should give you less lock  
contention by distributing the collision domains) vs. using one  
massive directory. You may yet end up with problems like directory  
fragmentation, but I'd rather have that problem that having all of my  
directory updates serialised against a BFL.

It's always good when you can get optimisations for free from your  
filesystem because it's just that good, but there are usually  
optimisations that you can wring out immediately on whatever you're  
using at the moment if you're willing and able to restructure your data.

Cheers,
Bayard
