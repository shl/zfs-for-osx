<PRE>Hi All:

I've been testing the latest build of ZFS on a 10.5.2 Mac Pro.  It's  
exciting to see this in development.  I'm really looking forward to  
using ZFS someday with all of its great features!

One of the applications I would like to use ZFS for in the future is  
for our IMAP mail stores.  I currently host our mail on and XServe  
with a directly attached Xserve RAID.  The RAID slice is level 5, with  
a hot spare. I have a new Intel Xserve that is slated to become the  
new mail server.  I also have on order one of the newly announced  
Promise VTrak RAID's.  So it got me thinking a little about what could  
be...

Once ZFS is production-ready on OS X, what is the optimal way to  
implement ZFS and a hardware RAID system such as the VTrak?  I've read  
some opinions on the Opensolaris ZFS discussion list, and it seems  
that people recommend using a RAID unit in a JBOD configuration, and  
using ZFS to handle the redundancy.  Is this the way to go?  I would  
think it would be, since you would be creating additional complexity  
to the setup by having redundancy at both the hardware and ZFS level.   
Am I correct or is this wooly thinking?

So if one uses a JBOD configuration, is raidz optimal?  Or would you  
use a pool made up of a collection of mirrored disks?  The Cyrus IMAP  
server on OS X stores each message as a single file, so as you would  
expect, the mail store has millions of small files contained within  
it.  What works best for data of this type?

Any insight is appreciated!

Thanks,
Bryan
