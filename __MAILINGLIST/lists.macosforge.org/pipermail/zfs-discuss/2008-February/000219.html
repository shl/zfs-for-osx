<PRE>hi folks,
I am a filesystem maven and I really enjoy experimenting and evaluating 
new filesystems. So when ZFS came out in Leopard I immediately read most 
of the available literature/blogs/mailing lists on ZFS and then started 
experimenting with it.

Here is my current setup:
I got a 8 drive cage from Fry's 
(<A HREF="http://www.datoptic.com/cgi-bin/web.cgi?product=eBOX-U&amp;detail=yes">http://www.datoptic.com/cgi-bin/web.cgi?product=eBOX-U&amp;detail=yes</A>) 
which has a USB 2.0 port to connect it to my mac. [ I know, single 
controller, single point of failure, but I think good enough for my 
purpose outlined below]

My current zpool is as follows:

GTank - 4 x 500 GB - raidz disks

I have 2 x 300gb disks that I want to add to the raidz GTank pool above. 
But as I understand from previous postings in the list I would need at 
least 2 more 300 GB disks to setup a second raidz array and then I would 
be able to add it to GTank. Is that right ?

Now, if instead i had the following configuration:

GTank - 4 x 500GB - mirror disks

then would I be able to do the following:

# zpool add GTank mirror disk4 disk 5

where disk4 &amp;5 are the 300GB disks..

My primary purpose of creating the zpool is to store Media files 
(movies, pictures, songs). These would not change a lot. 90% of the time 
there would be only READ activity on the disks and occasionally when I 
have new media I would WRITE to the disks.

In this scenario what is better ? Raidz or Mirror ??
