<PRE>So ZFS supports all extended attributes and handles them correctly  
currently.  I run my home directory off ZFS (so *all* my files are  
hosted off of a ZFS pool and this works fine).  Spotlight  
functionality however is a different matter all together and something  
we are working on.
But currently, you can store any file on ZFS that has extended  
attributes just fine(this includes anything with a resource fork),  it  
has full extended attribute support.
