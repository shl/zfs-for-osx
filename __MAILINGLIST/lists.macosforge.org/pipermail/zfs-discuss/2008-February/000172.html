<PRE>&gt;<i> Does the below statement mean mmap doesn't work on the solaris

</I>
No, mmap works fine on the Solaris version.  This issue was specific  
to our port on OSX.

&gt;<i> I mean what has to be changed, added and why ? Isn't it just a  
</I>&gt;<i> finished product by sun ?
</I>
Yes ZFS is a finished product by Sun and it works well and is in use  
at a number of business in production.  However, in order to port a  
filesystem a lot of changes have to be made since the rest of the  
system isn't Solaris, it's Mac OSX, so things work differently.
As Boyd mentioned, the VFS layer in OS X is quite different from  
Solaris, hence much of the ZFS ZPL code (the upper most layer of the  
filesystem) needed to change in order to accommodate this.  In  
addition, the OS X kernel is much different then the Solaris kernel,  
so there are changes that need to be made in order to accommodate that  
as well.   Disk interfacing and driver layers are also different, and  
the memory allocation schemes are different so adjustments to how ZFS  
works and what it expects in those areas had to be changed as well.   
Basically, a number of things needed to be changed and its still a  
work in progress.  Take a look at the source and compare the two if  
you're interested in more specifics.  But basically, they are two  
different operating systems that each work quite differently, hence  
just picking up the filesystem and dropping it into another operating  
system isn't exactly seamless :)
