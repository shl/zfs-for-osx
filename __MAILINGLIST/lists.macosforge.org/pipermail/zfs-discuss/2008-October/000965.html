<PRE>I've seen this behavior too.  I'm using a set of disks that are iSCSI
targets (multiple LUNs per target).

It smells like a race condition and it may have nothing to do with ZFS.

</I>&gt;<i> I am wondering if this is either an issue that is with how the HighPoint
</I>&gt;<i> controller is working, or some larger issue.
</I>&gt;<i> The above was one of the first times that it has &quot;misplaced&quot; two drives, as
</I>&gt;<i> usually it's only one that it is unable to find.
</I>&gt;<i> When it has been only one I have tried various forms of zfs replace (sudo,
</I>&gt;<i> unmounting, force-unmounting). It returns an error saying the destination
</I>&gt;<i> drive is already in use.
</I>&gt;<i> Best solution I have found so far, is to log off all users, SSH in and force
</I>&gt;<i> a unmount, do an export, then import and it has come back every time so far.
</I>&gt;<i> I do have to do a scrub, but it only finds checksum errors, which,
</I>&gt;<i> considering that it comes up without a drive and activity happens while
</I>&gt;<i> missing a drive or two, it makes sense to me so far.
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas of what to try?
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I don't have auto-login set, but I do have apache2 using a directory
</I>&gt;<i> of one of the mountpoints as the document root. The odd thing is, that
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes I will reboot and no issues at all, so I haven't found an exact
</I>&gt;<i> cause yet. The HighPoint controller does consider the drives to be volumes,
</I>&gt;<i> that I then &quot;export&quot; each drive volume from the controller as JBOD (total of
</I>&gt;<i> 4 volumes, one per disk). Only based on the fact that the expect drive ID's
</I>&gt;<i> are high enough to be on the controller, I'm suspecting some sort of delay
</I>&gt;<i> there...
</I>&gt;<i> If no one else is seeing this, then maybe it is just a odd combo of drives,
</I>&gt;<i> controller, DISK-&gt;JBOD-&gt;slices, idk, something funny.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for writing a novel, but I'm try to error on the side of too much
</I>&gt;<i> info... of course, please let me know what most basic I've forgotten to
</I>&gt;<i> include. ;)
