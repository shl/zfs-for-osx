<PRE>Hello,

Am running 10.5.5 Server (PPC) with ZFS 119.
I have a raidz logical volume (8 x 250GB physical) being shared via AFP.

I'm experiencing an issue via AFP where I cannot delete a folder if it  
contains items.
A Finder dialog box claims the folder is in use...

If the folder is empty, I can delete via AFP no problem.

Is this related to the same issue of files not being deleted by the  
Finder locally? or is this something new?

I searched the forums before posting this but couldn't find anything  
about deletion via AFP.

Regards,

&quot;... The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste, they  
have absolutely no taste and what that means is, and I don't mean that  
in a small way, I mean that in a big way.
In the sense that: they, they don't think of original ideas, and they  
don't bring much culture into their product.
And you say why is that important? well proportionally spaced fonts  
come from typesetting and beautiful books, that's where one gets the  
idea.  If it weren't for the mac they would never have that in their  
products.
And, so I guess I am saddened, not by Microsoft's success, I have no  
problem with their success. They've earned their success; for the most  
part.
I have a problem with the fact that they make just really third grade  
products ...&quot;
