<PRE>One of my big reason for using zfs is that I use both Macs and FreeBSD
machines regularly, and I like having a real filesystem (ntfs and fat
need not apply) that will work on both architectures. (Transferring a
hundred gigabytes by moving a disk is so much faster than shipping
them across a network.)

But on the FreeBSD side there is really no special character encoding
used for filenames, which means I typically end up just using
latin-1. And that spells trouble of course, when I access the
filesystem from a mac: ls will display the troublesome filenames, but
any attempt at stat()ing or accessing the file in any way will fail
(including ls -F of course).

Now the number of files involved is not huge in my case, but surely, I
cannot be the only person who runs into this problem? It would be nice
if there were an option to treat a zfs filesystem as having different
encodings of filenames.

Right now what I am thinking of is this: Mount the filesystem on
FreeBSD, run a find job to list all the troublesome pathnames and put
them in a file, transfer that list to the mac, and massage it (using
iconv) into a shell script I can run on the FreeBSD side to rename the
files into something the Mac can understand.

It shouldn't be this hard, IMO. Any thoughts?

- Harald
