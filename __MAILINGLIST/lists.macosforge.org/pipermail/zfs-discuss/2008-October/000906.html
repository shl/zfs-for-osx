<PRE>Good morning everyone,


as I might have mentioned before, I added another 3-way RAID.Z to my  
Pool.
The (by far) biggest use of this Pool is as a backup storage for quite  
a few ZFS-less OS X clients, which back up their home directories with  
rsync. Each rsync session finishes with a snapshot command.

The switches I'll use with rsync are the following:

rsync -aENHAXvz --fileflags --stats --progress --inplace --delete

AFAIK, --inplace replaces a file without first creating a new file and  
replacing the old one with it after a successful transfer later. This  
seems to be important for efficient ZFS snapshot creation - right?

According to various ZFS documentation, additional storage is only  
used for new data and COW'ed old data.
I'm not quite sure whether an inplace-replacement of files gets  
written on old or new data, but it seems the new RAID.Z is not used as  
much as it could be:

bash-3.2$ zpool iostat -v
                 capacity     operations    bandwidth
pool          used  avail   read  write   read  write
-----------  -----  -----  -----  -----  -----  -----

     disk2s2      -      -      0      1  12.2K  11.0K
-----------  -----  -----  -----  -----  -----  -----

I've added disks 2-4 (which, incidentally, have been 8-10 at the time  
I've added them) 6 days ago - during that time, as you can see, less  
than 2GB have been used on these disks, while the available capacity  
on the first three disks got reduced from ~70GB to &lt;33GB.

Should I be worried that I'll run out of space on the old disks?

Thank you.


Best regards,

Christian
