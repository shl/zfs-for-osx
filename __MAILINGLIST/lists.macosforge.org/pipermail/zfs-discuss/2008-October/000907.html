Matthew,

thank you for your input. It sounds plausible to be a case sensitive  
problem, since I also started with a HFS+ library. Although I could  
have sworn I've had the problem with the same file more than once...

I'll try to keep a list of all the files and check for duplicates.


Best regards,

Christian
