<PRE>As I mentioned in my previous email, I've only had one issue outside  
of the well known issues on the wiki.

I've held off on this one for a bit thinking that it might just be me  
and doing something wrong, but it's happening enough that it is, well  
frankly starting to scare me. I think that it only happens when I  
either restart or cold boot after a while. I have almost constant read/ 
write to the pool, and I run scrubs rather frequently, but unless I'm  
recovering from the following issues, I never have had an error.

General system info:
Mac Pro , 2.66GHz CPU , 6GB MEM
2 - 500GB Internal Drives (not part of the pool, RAID1)
2 - 500GB Internal Drives
4 - 640GB External Drives in a FirmTek SeriTek/5PM enclosure connected  
to a Highpoint RocketRAID 2314

Cold boot. I'm quite certain that all the external drives are powered  
up and spinning before I turn on my system, and here is the symptom  
that I see.

   pool: Indigo
  state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices could not be used because the label is  
missing or
	invalid.  Sufficient replicas exist for the pool to continue
	functioning in a degraded state.
action: Replace the device using 'zpool replace'.

errors: No known data errors

I am wondering if this is either an issue that is with how the  
HighPoint controller is working, or some larger issue.

The above was one of the first times that it has &quot;misplaced&quot; two  
drives, as usually it's only one that it is unable to find.
When it has been only one I have tried various forms of zfs replace  
(sudo, unmounting, force-unmounting). It returns an error saying the  
destination drive is already in use.

Best solution I have found so far, is to log off all users, SSH in and  
force a unmount, do an export, then import and it has come back every  
time so far. I do have to do a scrub, but it only finds checksum  
errors, which, considering that it comes up without a drive and  
activity happens while missing a drive or two, it makes sense to me so  
far.

Any ideas of what to try?

Also, I don't have auto-login set, but I do have apache2 using a  
directory of one of the mountpoints as the document root. The odd  
thing is, that sometimes I will reboot and no issues at all, so I  
haven't found an exact cause yet. The HighPoint controller does  
consider the drives to be volumes, that I then &quot;export&quot; each drive  
volume from the controller as JBOD (total of 4 volumes, one per disk).  
Only based on the fact that the expect drive ID's are high enough to  
be on the controller, I'm suspecting some sort of delay there...
If no one else is seeing this, then maybe it is just a odd combo of  
drives, controller, DISK-&gt;JBOD-&gt;slices, idk, something funny.

Sorry for writing a novel, but I'm try to error on the side of too  
much info... of course, please let me know what most basic I've  
forgotten to include. ;)
