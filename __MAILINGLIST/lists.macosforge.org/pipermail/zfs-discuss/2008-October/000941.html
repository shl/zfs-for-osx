<PRE>I've had this kind of transient problem as well.  In my case, one of  
the SATA cables inside my enclosure had gone bad (how the heck does  
this happen?)  I replaced the cable, rebuilt the mirror, and ZFS was  
happy.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, if anyone is interested, my personal conclusion: Don't Panic!
