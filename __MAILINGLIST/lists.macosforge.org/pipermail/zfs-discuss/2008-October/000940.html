Well, seems I have to talk to myself, since no one wants to answer  
me. ;-)

I decided not to replace the disk and didn't encounter any further  
problems (didn't do another scrub, though, due to the bug which causes  
the scrub to restart as soon as a snapshot is added - any chance for  
its fix to be implemented in OS X soon?).

After a planned reboot and therefore new mount, I issued another  
scrub, with a nearly completely filled pool (~5GB available) and: no  
more chksum errors.

I don't believe the blocks in question were all free during that time,  
so either the disk marked them as bad (don't think so) or it was not a  
sign for a bad disk, but some other problem - maybe during write/read,  
maybe due to the kernel panics the system had to endure, maybe one of  
the ZFS bugs displaying chksum errors which aren't there...

Anyway, if anyone is interested, my personal conclusion: Don't Panic!


Best regards,

Christian
