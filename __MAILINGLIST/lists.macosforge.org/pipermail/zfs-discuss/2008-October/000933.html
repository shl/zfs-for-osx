<PRE>I'm running zfs-119 downloaded yesterday from zfs.macosforge.org.

In the end I went with the &quot;sane&quot; option: 2x1TB mirrored and 3x500GB
RAIDZ'd.

I first added the mirror to the pool, since 2 of the 500GB disks currently
have data that will be moved into ZFS. I started copying with cpio but after
a while the copy hung.

I found out that one of my 1TB disks suddenly turns itself off for no
apparent reason. I get a bunch of IOUSBKit error messages in dmesg, and
zpool status tells me that &quot;One or more devices could not be opened.
Sufficient replicas exist for the pool to continue functioning in a degraded
state&quot;. The device in question shows as UNAVAIL and the pool and the mirror
as DEGRADED.

Why does the copy hang if the pool is still usable?

Now I turn the offending device off and on again. Thing is, OS X assigns it
a new device name. So I do an ls /dev/disk*, find out which is the latest
disk (from just a couple of seconds ago). If before it was disk4s2, it turns
out it's now disk7s2 (I have other disks on this machine). So I do a zpool
online plogiston /dev/disk7s2...which hangs. I next do a zpool
status...which hangs. I have to do a hard shutdown (holding down the power
button). I disconnect all other external hard drives to correctly identify
the parts of the pool and restart. I only have 2 external drives: disk1s2
(which is now online) and disk2s2 (which doesn't appear in zpool status, it
still says disk4s2). So I try a zpool online /dev/disk2s2 and it tells me
that device is not part of the pool. So now I seem to have half a mirror
(whichfor some reason is resilvering) and another disk which is completely
unavailable.

How could I recover from this situation?

At this point I could recreate the pool since I still have the original data
in the 2x500GB disks, but in the end these will be RAIDZ'ed with another
500GB and added to the pool. I of course need to get the faulty 1TB disk
replaced but at this point I don't think I can trust ZFS to give it all my
data. I would really like to know what's going on
