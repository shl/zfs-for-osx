<PRE>I'm a pretty knowledgeable mac user - started back with the 128k  
original mac. Have had various Mac desktops and laptops over the  
years. Actually worked for Apple for 10-ish years as an SE. But  
nowhere near anything like a sysadmin or such.

That being said, I'd like to pose a very basic question. Is ZFS  
envisioned being used in conjunction with external desktop drives, USB  
or Firewire, or is it targeted at the more &quot;professional&quot; parts of the  
mac community using SATA/eSATA drives? If it can be used with USB or  
Firewire, should the drives be virtually identical if used to create a  
pool? All USB, all 5400 or 7200 RPM? If someone has a somewhat random  
collection of USB and Firewire drives, can they be used to put  
together a &quot;poor man's&quot; ZFS implementation?

Can Time Machine still backup data off of a ZFS partition? I wasn't  
sure how to interpret this:

&gt;<i> Can I use ZFS with TM?
</I>&gt;<i> Not currently, ZFS volumes are not currently browsable through Time  
</I>&gt;<i> Machine
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I read this as I could not format a drive with ZFS and use it as a TM  
&quot;destination&quot;. Is that correct? Can an HFS-formatted drive backup data  
on a ZFS drive? Can you restore data to a ZFS drive from an HFS/TM  
drive?

Currently, I have a collection of external drives by various vendors  
connected to my dual proc G5 (hopefully soon to be a quad core iMac,  
whenever that happens). Firewire 400 and 800 and USB2.

The idea of not having to have a half a dozen external drives mounted  
in the Finder on my desktop as my storage needs expand would be GREAT!  
If I can just figure out exactly how to make it all &quot;play&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.

Thanks in advance,

Greg
