<PRE>try doing 'zpool status', if you put in a whole drive, you'll get  
status on the whole drive instead of the 's2' slice which is the  
reason you're pool isn't importing on boot.
Also, everyone can double check they partitioned their drive properly  
by doing a 'diskutil list'.

As Dillon mentioned, the only two reasons (at least I've ever seen)  
for a pool to not import on it's own is if it wasn't formated for ZFS  
first with diskutil, or if you passed ZFS the whole disk instead of  
the s2 slice.

the slowness in bringing up, especially for Dillon is likely due to  
the fact he has two drives.  The problem is diskutil is racing  
launchd, and as you've all seemed to witness, well, launchd usually  
wins.  So diskutil can't bring up the pool until all the devices are  
found and it has to go through on boot and sniff every single device  
it can find, regardless of what it is.  We're working on fixing this  
issue currently with making ZFS a first class IOkit citizen.  So hang  
tight.

I currently have my internal drive partitioned, small part for HFS+  
where the os sits, and the rest for ZFS which I use for all my data  
and my home directory.
