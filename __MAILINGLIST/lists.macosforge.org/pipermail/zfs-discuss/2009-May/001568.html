Completely.   But if you only gate it the partition then it's not just  
dangerous, is downright irresponsible.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isn't that what the gpt add command in your FreeBSD example did?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, no, it just updates the GPT partition table (how is that for

</I>
Sorry, that wasn't my meaning.  I meant that you give it a disk and it  
assumes that it understands the label structure in that disk and can  
therefore modify it.

</I>&gt;<i> an unused &quot;a&quot; partition the same size as the boot partition on the
</I>&gt;<i> boot disk, so he copied the boot partition over using dd, of course
</I>&gt;<i> copying the partition table along with it. Then he went off to a
</I>&gt;<i> usenix conference. The funny thing is, things started going wrong sort
</I>&gt;<i> of gradually, with more and more files becoming inaccessible. Worse,
</I>&gt;<i> our backup system had started failing at about the same time. But by
</I>&gt;<i> an incredible stroke of luck I had saved a copy of all partition
</I>&gt;<i> tables on the system just a few days prior to this, and so I was able
</I>&gt;<i> to recreate the correct partition table and save the day (and a whole
</I>&gt;<i> slew of data).
</I>
But GPT is actually using something like 256K of space before the EFI  
partition for its stuff.

Its not ferretted away in the first cylinder of the EFI partition.

The 200MB  EFI partition is generally empty unless you're using a  
third party boot loader.

Its purpose isn't very closely defined.

This makes it even less acceptable for MacOS ZFS to assume that it  
owns the whole disk when it was really only given the second partition.
