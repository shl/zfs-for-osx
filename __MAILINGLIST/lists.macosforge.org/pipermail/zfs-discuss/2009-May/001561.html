</I>
And your point is? Please note what I said:

&quot;That's not the case. If you give the whole disk (with one zfs
partition) it kicks in the optimisations. If you have more partitions
on there, it doesn't &quot;

The EFI partition is akin to the master boot record on other disks.
It's not a 'real' partition (though it can be mounted as such). ZFS
uses a whole-disk concept not to take up any more (or less) space, but
rather to guarantee that it has sole use of the disk cache. If you
don't have the whole disk, it assumes that the disk is mixed use, and
doesn't use the cache when writing to disk (with the resulting slow
down that this may cause).

However, it is my understanding that if you create a disk with a
single ZFS partition and no other filesystem partitions (i.e.
specifying the 100% on the command line) then you will benefit from
these optimizations which are specific to Mac OS X. The EFI partition
is treated as a driver location, much like earlier Apple Partitions on
PPCs stored OS9 drivers. In other words, it's treated as a boot device
which isn't mounted again at runtime; therefore, ZFS can assume
ownership of the cache.

&gt;<i> This shows clearly in the Getting Started example.
</I>&gt;<i> read the output in the example.
</I>&gt;<i> # diskutil partitiondisk /dev/disk2 GPTFormat ZFS %noformat% 100%
</I>
Right, this is the command you should have used. The GPTFormat will
result in the 200Mb EFI partition; however, the usable disk space is
given over to ZFS at 100%. 100% of the usable disk != 100% of the raw
disk.

&gt;<i> When the getting started says for best results give it the whole disk,  the
</I>&gt;<i> correct interpretation is disk2.
</I>
Unfortunately, it was not the correct interpretation.

&gt;<i> So what Teng Yao and I independently did was to follow the recommendation
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. to label the disk with a GPT label and then give ZFS the whole disk
</I>
No, you followed what you thought was the recommendation but in fact wasn't.

&gt;<i> But that is NOT what importing a zpool is about. &#160;Its about moving an
</I>&gt;<i> exported zpool from one machine (type) to another.
</I>
The Mac kernel does not recognize raw disks in ZFS format (in 10.5
with 119). It's quite possible that will change with 10.6. Note that
the ZFS on-disk format actually leaves a couple of hundred meg spare
at the front to allow for a EFI partition, so it's quite likely
they'll use both.

However, not using a ZFS partition means it doesn't get imported automatically.

&gt;<i> Its not an adjunct to mounting process. &#160;This isn't just a case of disks
</I>&gt;<i> that haven't mounted. &#160;The disks zpools are lost unless the user takes
</I>&gt;<i> exceptional action to recover them.
</I>
Right, hence the instructions tell you how to do it properly.

&gt;<i> But I go back to my original statement that what one should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> expect from the MacOS ZFS documentation is highlighting of these quirks
</I>&gt;<i> rather than provide incorrect recommendations that lead to failure
</I>&gt;<i> situations and then have that followed up by users being wrongly told to go
</I>&gt;<i> back and read the documentation.
</I>
As usual, RTFM.
