<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; isn't that what the gpt add command in your FreeBSD example did?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, no, it just updates the GPT partition table (how is that for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; redundant acronym usage?), adding a new partition.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, that wasn't my meaning.  I meant that you give it a disk and it
</I>&gt;<i> assumes that it understands the label structure in that disk and can
</I>&gt;<i> therefore modify it.
</I>
I think you lost me here. I assume you are not writing this merely to
point out that a program whose purpose is to manipulate GPT actually
understands the structure of GPT. I also guess that whatever
misunderstanding we have here is not important to clear up, but if you
think it is, feel free to enter teaspoon feeding mode.

&gt;<i> But GPT is actually using something like 256K of space before the EFI
</I>&gt;<i> partition for its stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Its not ferretted away in the first cylinder of the EFI partition.
</I>
Right. Which is why I am puzzled as to what you are driving at.
