Hi

There is something very wrong with the MacOS ZFS documentation (and  
also to an extent software).

I have been using ZFS under Solaris for a couple of years and know it  
to a superb facility.

Otherwise, my initial experience on the Mac would have caused me to  
bin it.

Lets start with the Documentation.  The main ZFS documentation set  
documents ZFS so what I am looking for from the Mac side is simply to  
document the differences and issues in using the software under  
MacOS.   If fails dismally.

It fails so badly that I, and others, are loosing zpools  (Oh, God, I  
lost every thing after a reboot !!!).

Lets start with the &quot;getting started&quot;.

Paragraph one.

	&quot;In all cases, the disks need to use the GUID Partition Table (GPT)  
and ZFS typically works best when it owns the entire disk due in part  
to how conservative it is with the write cache.&quot;

Now it is well documented that ZFS works best when it owns the entire  
disk, partly I believe because it can then control the caching  
strategy for the disk.

The trouble is that under MacOS it seems to be essential that you  
DON'T give ZFS the whole disk.  If you do it will work fine until you  
reboot and then it'll trash your zpool.

The examples work rather better than the stated advice.

	# diskutil partitiondisk /dev/disk2 GPTFormat ZFS %noformat% 100%
	# zpool create puddle /dev/disk2s2

OK,  that works fine BUT

A)	It does NOT give ZFS the whole disk.  It gives a single partition  
i.e.  slice 2 of the disk.   This is most of the disk but not the  
whole of it.

B)	It silently introduces a new concept which is a partition of type  
ZFS which isn't even offered as an option in diskutil.app but which  
seems to be essential for a stable zpool.

C)	Why introduce a new user to a single disk zpool.   Thats about as  
useful as a banking regulator.

And I am left trying to guess whether the Mac ZFS handles a 100% ZFS  
slice in a GPT partition as being the whole disk for caching purposes,  
or whether I end up with a degraded ZFS because it doesn't have the  
whole disk.

What else don't you tell us.  Lets look ahead a little.

Well how about the zfs command.  Anyone used to ZFS will know that the  
ZFS filesystem created by the zpool command is not generally used as a  
working filesystems but as an administrative bucket for the zpool.

After creating the zpool it is then normal to add your ZFS filesystems  
using the zpool command.  This is completely unmentioned, which helps  
gloss over the problems mounting other ZFS file systems once created.


Then there is the fact that about one or two ZFS partition creation  
commands,  the disk system gets manically busy for an indeterminate  
period of time, &quot;diskutil list&quot; returns unstable results and the  
machine is likely to freeze.

It seems to be best to build one ZFS partition at time.  Wait for all  
disk activity to stop, and then reboot, before building the next one.

So now lets look at the software.  The good news is that it is  
possible to build a working ZFS filesystem if you a) do that is  
expected rather than what the &quot;getting started&quot; says works best and b)  
build the ZFS partitions very gently.

But if instead you follow the worded instructions, ZFS manual, general  
ZFS documentation etc, and give it the whole disk

	zpool create lake raidz /dev/disk2 /dev/disk3 /dev/disk4 /dev/disk5

You now have a whole pile of trouble.  loss of the whole zpool when  
you reboot is just the beginning.

Because while you go off and start again trying to set up your  
system.  zfs gets clever and starts trying to recover the zpool.  I  
never succeeds, but it wont easily stop either.

There is a very pretty situation in diskutil.app where all the  
partitions that were part of &quot;lake&quot; keep appearing and vanishing  
again, out of phase with each other, at about one second intervals.

Reformat the disks as MBR all free space and then back as GPT (usually  
clears anything), but no,  zfs still finds them again.

Documetation is very clear that you must delete the zpool using the  
zpool destroy command.

But you can't do that when ZFS think that the pool doesn't exist.

In the end the only way I managed to move forward was to zero the  
disks with Ranish from a live linux cd.

And this is all the consequence of following the standard advise in  
the MacOS ZFS &quot;getting started&quot;, e.g. that &quot;ZFS typically works best  
when it owns the entire disk&quot;.

I note that on this list only last week Teng Yao had the same problem  
(Oh, God, I lost every thing after a reboot !!!)

and Alex Blewitt helpfully replied that

&quot;The documentation suggested /dev/disk0s2 would have been better,
rather than /dev/disk0, as otherwise ti doesn't mount on boot. That
sounds like what's happened here.&quot;

Er - Well actually it doesn't.  That may be what it does in the  
example,  but it clearly advises that you use the whole disk.
	
Sorry if I am ranting a little but this is a serious mess.
