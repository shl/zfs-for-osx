?  That is more a legal and marketing issue than anything else.  From  
a technical point of view, MacOS is a Unix based operating system.    
After 40 years you'll learn to spot one.  That doesn't mean that it  
hasn't any of its own ways of doing things.

To quote Apple Inc.  &quot;There are over 15 million Mac OS X users&#8212; 
scientists, animators, developers, system administrators, and more&#8212; 
making Mac OS X the most widely used UNIX-based desktop operating  
system.&quot;

I'm sure the 15m is now well out of date.

</I>
That is a red herring.   diskN is an abbreviation for /dev/diskN.

The discussion is whether, at the point in time the zpool command is  
used,  diskN or diskNsM can be described as the whole disk.

I suspect that this is a carry over of the /dev herring.   If the  
average OS X sysadmin considers diskNsM to be a whole disk than

My interjection was about the overbearing and supercilious snubbing of  
a user who sent in a perfectly reasonable issue where he had lost his  
zpool and was dismissed because he had ignored the getting started  
documentation.

The discussion had become protracted because the writer of that  
dismissal is determined to use ever increasing babel towers of  
confusion, rather than just recognise the inappropriateness of the  
attitude to a user who had made a perfectly reasonable pass at  
following the recommendations.

If you prefer this group encourage such behaviour toward new users  
then continue ignoring their problems and pretending that they don't  
exist.
