<PRE>

This whole controversy was about whether the wording of paragraph 1 of  
the MacOS ZFS &quot;getting started&quot;.


.... A pool may consist of one or more whole disks or disk  
partitions. .... ZFS typically works best when it owns the entire  
disk ....

I say whole disk means diskN and not diskNs2.

Several of you seem to think that it is clear that MacOS GPT is  
special and on it whole disk means diskNs2 and not diskN and that  
those that think otherwise are being somehow odd.

Well it turns out that MacOS 10.5.6's diskutil has its own view on  
what is a whole disk.  And I for one am not surprised to see that is  
agrees with the last 40 years of Unix usage and not with the MacOS ZFS  
getting started unique view.

Alex-Bowdens-Computer:~ alex$ diskutil info  /dev/disk0
    Device Identifier:        disk0
    Device Node:              /dev/disk0
    Part Of Whole:            disk0
    ...
    Whole:                    Yes
    ...
Alex-Bowdens-Computer:~ alex$ diskutil info  /dev/disk0s1
    Device Identifier:        disk0s1
    Device Node:              /dev/disk0s1
    Part Of Whole:            disk0
    ...
    Whole:                    No
    ...
Alex-Bowdens-Computer:~ alex$ diskutil info  /dev/disk0s2
    Device Identifier:        disk0s2
    Device Node:              /dev/disk0s2
    Part Of Whole:            disk0
    ...
    Whole:                    No
    ...


So.  Those of you that just can't cope with changing your view, I  
suggest you send a bug report to Apple and tell them that you think  
that diskutil is wrong.

But please spare me any more bizarre arguments that MacOS is somehow  
different, and that white is black and black is white.
