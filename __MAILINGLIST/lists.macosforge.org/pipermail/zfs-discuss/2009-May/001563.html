You really don't listen to a word people say do you?

The bottom line is that

	/dev/disk2 = whole disk

	/dev/disk2s2 = a slice or partition

If you're still confused please see The Ladybird Book of Computers.

The documentation does not say to give ZFS the whole of the usable  
disk as a partition.  It says give ZFS the whole disk.

The rest is bull and obfustication of the issue to cover up the fact  
that you have been putting people down for not reading the  
documentation, without bothering to check that it was right.

The purpose of documentation, particularly &quot;getting started&quot;  
documentation, is not to have some obscure interpretation that might  
be seen as right by someone trying to justify his failure to read it  
before quoting it to others, but to be unambiguously convey the  
correct information to the reader.

Furthermore, the usage of zpool that you propose, in assuming  
ownership of a resource beyond  the stripe that it is given, goes  
against 40 years of Unix convention and is dangerously bad practice.

There is no reason why it shouldn't be given the whole disk and still  
maintain the GTP format and two slices within that structure and use  
just the second one.  That conforms to Unix usage.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With respect you are simply wrong.

</I>&gt;<i> And your point is? Please note what I said:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;That's not the case. If you give the whole disk (with one zfs
</I>&gt;<i> partition) it kicks in the optimisations. If you have more partitions
</I>&gt;<i> on there, it doesn't &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The EFI partition is akin to the master boot record on other disks.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not a 'real' partition (though it can be mounted as such). ZFS
</I>&gt;<i> uses a whole-disk concept not to take up any more (or less) space, but
</I>&gt;<i> rather to guarantee that it has sole use of the disk cache. If you
</I>&gt;<i> don't have the whole disk, it assumes that the disk is mixed use, and
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't use the cache when writing to disk (with the resulting slow
</I>&gt;<i> down that this may cause).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is my understanding that if you create a disk with a
</I>&gt;<i> single ZFS partition and no other filesystem partitions (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> specifying the 100% on the command line) then you will benefit from
</I>&gt;<i> these optimizations which are specific to Mac OS X. The EFI partition
</I>&gt;<i> is treated as a driver location, much like earlier Apple Partitions on
</I>&gt;<i> PPCs stored OS9 drivers. In other words, it's treated as a boot device
</I>&gt;<i> which isn't mounted again at runtime; therefore, ZFS can assume
</I>&gt;<i> ownership of the cache.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This shows clearly in the Getting Started example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> read the output in the example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # diskutil partitiondisk /dev/disk2 GPTFormat ZFS %noformat% 100%
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, this is the command you should have used. The GPTFormat will
</I>&gt;<i> result in the 200Mb EFI partition; however, the usable disk space is
</I>&gt;<i> given over to ZFS at 100%. 100% of the usable disk != 100% of the raw
</I>&gt;<i> disk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When the getting started says for best results give it the whole  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disk,  the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correct interpretation is disk2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, it was not the correct interpretation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So what Teng Yao and I independently did was to follow the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recommendation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i.e. to label the disk with a GPT label and then give ZFS the whole  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disk
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, you followed what you thought was the recommendation but in fact  
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But that is NOT what importing a zpool is about.  Its about moving an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exported zpool from one machine (type) to another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Mac kernel does not recognize raw disks in ZFS format (in 10.5
</I>&gt;<i> with 119). It's quite possible that will change with 10.6. Note that
</I>&gt;<i> the ZFS on-disk format actually leaves a couple of hundred meg spare
</I>&gt;<i> at the front to allow for a EFI partition, so it's quite likely
</I>&gt;<i> they'll use both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, not using a ZFS partition means it doesn't get imported  
</I>&gt;<i> automatically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Its not an adjunct to mounting process.  This isn't just a case of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that haven't mounted.  The disks zpools are lost unless the user  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> takes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exceptional action to recover them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, hence the instructions tell you how to do it properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I go back to my original statement that what one should be able  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expect from the MacOS ZFS documentation is highlighting of these  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quirks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than provide incorrect recommendations that lead to failure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situations and then have that followed up by users being wrongly  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> told to go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back and read the documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As usual, RTFM.
