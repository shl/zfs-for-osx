<PRE>I suspect your analysis - that you were ranting - isn't far off the  
mark.

There has been no public development of ZFS since 119 and at this  
point, there won't be any for 10.5.

10.6 is round the corner and will have tighter integration with the  
OS, especially finder/spotlight. Those won't be backported to 10.5.

The reason for the partition on a disk (rather than the &quot;well known&quot;  
whole disk thing) is to allow the kernel to mount it automatically. It  
can still be mounted manually if you want. The instructions do say to  
follow this advice - and FWIW if you give the OSX a &quot;full&quot; disk  
(albeit in a partition) then I believe the whole disk optimisations  
kick in.

Diskutil (GUI) will have support in 10.6 but not 10.5.

There are two recurring issues on this list;

1) I used a USB disk with a non-replicated FS and when I pulled it the  
machine froze
2) my pool doesn't mount on boot

For 1, later versions of ZFS in Solaris have an option to not panic on  
ZFS failure. However, it is not and will never be in 10.5. Anyway, if  
you're not replicating data you're at a risk of data loss.

For 2, follow the instructions on the getting started page, and not  
what you think they say.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is something very wrong with the MacOS ZFS documentation (and  
</I>&gt;<i> also to an extent software).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been using ZFS under Solaris for a couple of years and know  
</I>&gt;<i> it to a superb facility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, my initial experience on the Mac would have caused me to  
</I>&gt;<i> bin it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lets start with the Documentation.  The main ZFS documentation set  
</I>&gt;<i> documents ZFS so what I am looking for from the Mac side is simply  
</I>&gt;<i> to document the differences and issues in using the software under  
</I>&gt;<i> MacOS.   If fails dismally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It fails so badly that I, and others, are loosing zpools  (Oh, God,  
</I>&gt;<i> I lost every thing after a reboot !!!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lets start with the &quot;getting started&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Paragraph one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	&quot;In all cases, the disks need to use the GUID Partition Table (GPT)  
</I>&gt;<i> and ZFS typically works best when it owns the entire disk due in  
</I>&gt;<i> part to how conservative it is with the write cache.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now it is well documented that ZFS works best when it owns the  
</I>&gt;<i> entire disk, partly I believe because it can then control the  
</I>&gt;<i> caching strategy for the disk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The trouble is that under MacOS it seems to be essential that you  
</I>&gt;<i> DON'T give ZFS the whole disk.  If you do it will work fine until  
</I>&gt;<i> you reboot and then it'll trash your zpool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The examples work rather better than the stated advice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	# diskutil partitiondisk /dev/disk2 GPTFormat ZFS %noformat% 100%
</I>&gt;<i> 	# zpool create puddle /dev/disk2s2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK,  that works fine BUT
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A)	It does NOT give ZFS the whole disk.  It gives a single partition  
</I>&gt;<i> i.e.  slice 2 of the disk.   This is most of the disk but not the  
</I>&gt;<i> whole of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> B)	It silently introduces a new concept which is a partition of type  
</I>&gt;<i> ZFS which isn't even offered as an option in diskutil.app but which  
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be essential for a stable zpool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> C)	Why introduce a new user to a single disk zpool.   Thats about as  
</I>&gt;<i> useful as a banking regulator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I am left trying to guess whether the Mac ZFS handles a 100% ZFS  
</I>&gt;<i> slice in a GPT partition as being the whole disk for caching  
</I>&gt;<i> purposes, or whether I end up with a degraded ZFS because it doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> have the whole disk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What else don't you tell us.  Lets look ahead a little.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well how about the zfs command.  Anyone used to ZFS will know that  
</I>&gt;<i> the ZFS filesystem created by the zpool command is not generally  
</I>&gt;<i> used as a working filesystems but as an administrative bucket for  
</I>&gt;<i> the zpool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After creating the zpool it is then normal to add your ZFS  
</I>&gt;<i> filesystems using the zpool command.  This is completely  
</I>&gt;<i> unmentioned, which helps gloss over the problems mounting other ZFS  
</I>&gt;<i> file systems once created.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then there is the fact that about one or two ZFS partition creation  
</I>&gt;<i> commands,  the disk system gets manically busy for an indeterminate  
</I>&gt;<i> period of time, &quot;diskutil list&quot; returns unstable results and the  
</I>&gt;<i> machine is likely to freeze.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to be best to build one ZFS partition at time.  Wait for  
</I>&gt;<i> all disk activity to stop, and then reboot, before building the next  
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So now lets look at the software.  The good news is that it is  
</I>&gt;<i> possible to build a working ZFS filesystem if you a) do that is  
</I>&gt;<i> expected rather than what the &quot;getting started&quot; says works best and  
</I>&gt;<i> b) build the ZFS partitions very gently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if instead you follow the worded instructions, ZFS manual,  
</I>&gt;<i> general ZFS documentation etc, and give it the whole disk
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	zpool create lake raidz /dev/disk2 /dev/disk3 /dev/disk4 /dev/disk5
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You now have a whole pile of trouble.  loss of the whole zpool when  
</I>&gt;<i> you reboot is just the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because while you go off and start again trying to set up your  
</I>&gt;<i> system.  zfs gets clever and starts trying to recover the zpool.  I  
</I>&gt;<i> never succeeds, but it wont easily stop either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a very pretty situation in diskutil.app where all the  
</I>&gt;<i> partitions that were part of &quot;lake&quot; keep appearing and vanishing  
</I>&gt;<i> again, out of phase with each other, at about one second intervals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reformat the disks as MBR all free space and then back as GPT  
</I>&gt;<i> (usually clears anything), but no,  zfs still finds them again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Documetation is very clear that you must delete the zpool using the  
</I>&gt;<i> zpool destroy command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you can't do that when ZFS think that the pool doesn't exist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the end the only way I managed to move forward was to zero the  
</I>&gt;<i> disks with Ranish from a live linux cd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And this is all the consequence of following the standard advise in  
</I>&gt;<i> the MacOS ZFS &quot;getting started&quot;, e.g. that &quot;ZFS typically works best  
</I>&gt;<i> when it owns the entire disk&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I note that on this list only last week Teng Yao had the same  
</I>&gt;<i> problem (Oh, God, I lost every thing after a reboot !!!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and Alex Blewitt helpfully replied that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The documentation suggested /dev/disk0s2 would have been better,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than /dev/disk0, as otherwise ti doesn't mount on boot. That
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like what's happened here.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Er - Well actually it doesn't.  That may be what it does in the  
</I>&gt;<i> example,  but it clearly advises that you use the whole disk.
</I>&gt;<i> 	
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry if I am ranting a little but this is a serious mess.
