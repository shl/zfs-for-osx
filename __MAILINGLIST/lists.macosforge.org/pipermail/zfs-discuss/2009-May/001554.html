The documentation states that this is a known issue;  you have to use  
the &quot;-f&quot; flag to force it.

from the FAQ:
Why do I always have to use -f to export or unmount my zfs pools? I'm  
not using them.

True you aren't, but fseventsd is. We're working on a way to get  
unmount to trigger fseventsd to release it's hold on the filesystem  
but as for now, you'll need to force unmount/export your filesystems  
in order to get fseventsd to let go of it's hold.
