<PRE>+ Alex Bowden &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">alex at designlifecycle.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> &gt; It is a reasonable interpretation, until (and if) you realize that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doing so will overwrite the partition table you just created. At which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point it doesn't seem very reasonable at all, does it? But I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certainly understand how you reached this conclusion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That assumes what you already know or believe ZFS does with the item
</I>&gt;<i> it is given.
</I>
In my case, it is &quot;believe&quot; rather than &quot;know&quot;.

&gt;<i> If you give it a partition it can clearly only use that partition.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you give it complete disk with a GPT label on it, then it is quite
</I>&gt;<i> at liberty to just use those parts of the disk that are intended for
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
It is, but to me it seems dangerous to bet on it.

&gt;<i> isn't that what the gpt add command in your FreeBSD example did?
</I>
Well, no, it just updates the GPT partition table (how is that for
redundant acronym usage?), adding a new partition.

&gt;<i> This is the Unix world where root and swap partitions have known how
</I>&gt;<i> not to stomp on the boot block for 40 years.
</I>
Um, I admit I had forgotten about that. But I always thought of it as
a rather horrible hack, made necessary by the partition table actually
residing inside the first partition. I even had a rather harrowing
experience due to this, ages ago: This was on an old SunOS box (before
the name Solaris was invented IIRC), where our sysadmin had wanted to
have a spare boot partition on an external disk. That disk already had
an unused &quot;a&quot; partition the same size as the boot partition on the
boot disk, so he copied the boot partition over using dd, of course
copying the partition table along with it. Then he went off to a
usenix conference. The funny thing is, things started going wrong sort
of gradually, with more and more files becoming inaccessible. Worse,
our backup system had started failing at about the same time. But by
an incredible stroke of luck I had saved a copy of all partition
tables on the system just a few days prior to this, and so I was able
to recreate the correct partition table and save the day (and a whole
slew of data).
