<PRE>+ Alex Bowden &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">alex at designlifecycle.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Because the Apple GPT implementation reserves a 200MB EFI slice.
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> So in this case, giving ZFS disk2s2 only gives it 98% of the disk.
</I>&gt;<i> Not the whole disk.
</I>
I'll grant you that the &quot;getting started&quot; document is highly
misleading on this point. This is one reason I prefer to use FreeBSD
for partitioning and zpool creation:

#; gpt create -f da2
#; gpt add -t 6a898cc3-1dd2-11b2-99a6-080020736631 da2
#; zpool create poolname da2p1

(that long argument is the uuid that os x recognizes as signifying a
zfs partition).

&gt;<i> Now I do believe that giving it 100% of the available partition
</I>&gt;<i> space after GPT takes its bit, may well kick in the whole disk
</I>&gt;<i> optimisations which is why I asked that question.
</I>
There are a whole lot of heuristics that could be used for deciding
whether to go for whole disk optimisation. For example, one could look
to see if there are more than one active filesystem living on the
disk. If this is the method used, it doesn't matter if there are other
partitions.

&gt;<i> When the getting started says for best results give it the whole
</I>&gt;<i> disk, the correct interpretation is disk2.
</I>
It is a reasonable interpretation, until (and if) you realize that
doing so will overwrite the partition table you just created. At which
point it doesn't seem very reasonable at all, does it? But I can
certainly understand how you reached this conclusion.
