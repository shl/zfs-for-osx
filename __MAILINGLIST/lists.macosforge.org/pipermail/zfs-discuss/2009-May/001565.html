But this is *not* unix, it's OS X / Darwin. Just like Solaris is not  
unix either.

So trying to presume unix parlance equates on OS X is equally  
questionable. Generally speaking under OS X you don't consider /dev/ 
diskN as a &quot;disk&quot; since this will vary across reboots and system event  
transitions. &quot;diskN&quot; would be used, and it is seen by the OS in this  
case as the partition.

You do have a fair argument that there's room for improvement and  
clarity in the beta docs, but they're not &quot;very wrong&quot; by their  
readership, and with the attitude you're using it's unlikely you're  
going to win many supporters, especially since the current parlance  
does match what a OS X sysadmin is likely to understand and view as  
correct or acceptable verbiage.

Feel free to flame on, but you've already losing your audience with  
your ranting and what at least this reader views as a juvenile  
attitude towards working with the community.
