I agree that that is a fundamental issue.

And while I would argue that it would have been better to indicate to  
ZFS that is has such exclusive access by semanically giving it the  
whole disk in the zpool command, one must accept that this isn't how  
it was set up.

On the other hand I have seen no valid argument supporting the  
position that it would be unreasonable to give it the whole disk and  
therefore anyone doing so is an idiot to be dismissed out of hand.
