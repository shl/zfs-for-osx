<PRE>Okay,

I got hoondimac.com registered.  Will post a detailed write up of  
below's efforts for all to see shortly.

Anyone here used Solaris' ZFS with iSCSI and share out to Macs by  
chance?

I'm not really keen on setting up netatalk if I can help it. (<A HREF="http://cafenate.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/building-netatalk-on-opensolaris-200811/">http://cafenate.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/building-netatalk-on-opensolaris-200811/</A> 
)

Will let people know once site it up..

Cheers,

&gt;<i> I installed NexentaCore 2 (RC3) on a Mac Mini last weekend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a couple of attempts at it, as the installer script didn't  
</I>&gt;<i> seem to like a static ip in the end.  (kept stalling right at the end)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a bit concerned about the lack of ZFS being mentioned with snow  
</I>&gt;<i> leopard so I'm looking for alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About a month ago, I was wondering if I could get a Mac Mini to  
</I>&gt;<i> address 8 or more drives without using FW or USB.
</I>&gt;<i> At present, I have a G4 mobo inside an old ANS500 case using ZFS  
</I>&gt;<i> with 8 x 250GB PATA drives. (10.5.7)
</I>&gt;<i> I've never had a single problem with this setup and have replaced 3  
</I>&gt;<i> drives over a 2.5 year period due to errors.
</I>&gt;<i> I've never used USB or FW buses with ZFS, and I think this has kept  
</I>&gt;<i> me well away from a lot of trouble I see in this forum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's only due to the PATA to SATA transition that I'm looking to  
</I>&gt;<i> update this server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wanting to stick with the idea of not to use USB or FW buses for  
</I>&gt;<i> ZFS, I did some homework, spent some money on the Mac Mini, and now  
</I>&gt;<i> can  connect 10 SATA drives to a Mac mini.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know of anyone else in the world who's done this,  (or are  
</I>&gt;<i> stupid enough to) or have posted it anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it's a bit, ah... ahem... weird at present, but it is only a proof- 
</I>&gt;<i> of-concept to see if it would actually work.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/tangles/embarrasing-but-works.png">http://homepage.mac.com/tangles/embarrasing-but-works.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It works, and works rather well.  I striped the two 1TB drives  
</I>&gt;<i> within OS X at present, just to gauge a speed. (99MB/sec sustained)
</I>&gt;<i> Because the Mac Mini is to be installed inside the ANS500 case,  
</I>&gt;<i> (Apple Network Server 500), aesthetics have no relevance here.  8))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll write it up properly once I get a jig happening to hold the  
</I>&gt;<i> Sata card in place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

&quot;... The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste, they  
have absolutely no taste and what that means is, and I don't mean that  
in a small way, I mean that in a big way.
In the sense that: they, they don't think of original ideas, and they  
don't bring much culture into their product.
And you say why is that important? well proportionally spaced fonts  
come from typesetting and beautiful books, that's where one gets the  
idea.  If it weren't for the mac they would never have that in their  
products.
And, so I guess I am saddened, not by Microsoft's success, I have no  
problem with their success. They've earned their success; for the most  
part.
I have a problem with the fact that they make just really third grade  
products ...&quot;
