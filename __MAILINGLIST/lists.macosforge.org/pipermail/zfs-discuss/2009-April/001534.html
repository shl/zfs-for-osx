<PRE>I apologize if this is already addressed somewhere in the list  
archives.  I've spent time looking for an answer but haven't found  
one.  I also apologize for the length of this post.  I'm trying to  
include as many details as possible so I don't waste anyone's time.

Summary:
When I use an external USB attached drive with ZFS performance drops  
to about 40% of an HFS+ partition.  The same is true for Firewire  
attached drives.

Details:
* I'm wanting to use an external ZFS drive to store data - photos in  
particular.  So lots (100k+) of 1-12M files.
* Downloaded and installed zfs-119 (on an MacBook Pro running 10.5.6)
* I noticed when copying files to the drive that it would &quot;pause&quot;  
every 3-5 seconds or so (I could hear the drive heads moving about and  
then nothing for a second or two).
* I switched to an &quot;rsync&quot; style copy (rsync -a --progress) so I could  
see a little better what was happening.  Every 3-5 or so seconds it  
would just &quot;stop&quot; in the middle of a copy for a few seconds.
* I stopped the copy, deleted the files from the ZFS drive, and  
started again... This time running zpool iostat 1 in a different shell  
window.  (Output attached below - depending on the sampling and timing  
you can see either the &quot;0&quot; for write bandwidth during the pauses or a  
small number typically occurring every 3-4 seconds).
* I checked my CPU during the process - not CPU bound (max was about  
10% CPU usage including kernel)
* The net impact of the pauses is to significantly slow down write  
times.  To copy just 2.9GB of photos was taking about 3.5 to 4 minutes.
* Thinking something was wrong with the drive, I tried another  
external drive I have.  Same behavior... it &quot;pauses&quot; every so often.
* Then thinking it must be the drive I was copying the files from I  
tried copying from different drives.  Same behavior.
* Then finally wondering if it was ZFS, I destroyed the ZFS partition  
and recreated it (same spot on the physical disk) with HFS+.  I re-ran  
the copy.  This time there were no &quot;pauses&quot; of the disk head movement  
and the copy completed in slightly under 2 minutes.
* I re-tried the HFS+ partition copy a few times and got the same  
numbers plus/minus a few seconds.  Switching the partition back to ZFS  
and re-doing the copy yet again I noticed the same performance issues  
- about 4 minutes and frequent &quot;pauses&quot; in the copy process (as  
evidenced by the iostat and listening to the drive head movement).
* Wondering if it was USB related somehow I switched to using a  
Firewire drive and repeated the tests.  Same basic results.  ZFS was  
&quot;pausing&quot; during the writes to the disk.

So, any suggestions on what to try next?  Are there any &quot;tunables&quot; I  
should be aware of?  Copies are set to &quot;1&quot; and compression is  
&quot;off&quot; (see the zfs get all output below).  I know ZFS does more, but  
somehow I doubt that Sun engineers would have made ZFS have such bad  
performance which makes me wonder if it's my system, or the zfs port  
or something else.  Any thoughts?  Suggestions?   Can anyone recreate  
the problem?

Supporting Data:
Data being copied for this test:
* One directory with 7 sub-directories.
* A total of 1065 files.  Average size for this batch of files about  
2.8M
