<PRE>Well, after much trial and tribulations, I've finally got my home
drives over NFS with a ZFS backend. All I need now is for a stable
NFS4 that can handle xattrs over the wire and I'm golden :-) Mind you,
that's not going to come until 10.7 &quot;Rain puppy&quot;.

The good:
* I've got ZFS on the back-end, with snapshots and everything.
* Compression is a bonus, especially for /Library/Documentation.
Doesn't seem to impact files that much - I have it on for all shares
at the moment. Largest compression ratio is 1.31x, (developer stuff,
CVS repo etc.)
* xattr properties are cool
* copies=2 is great for data when you're on a laptop
* crontab is your friend:
@reboot /usr/sbin/zfs scrub Data
@daily /usr/sbin/zfs scrub Data
#If you really want to get silly
@hourly /usr/sbin/zfs snapshot -r <A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">Data at AutoH-</A>`date +&quot;\%FT\%H:\%M&quot;`
@daily /usr/sbin/zfs snapshot -r <A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">Data at AutoD-</A>`date +&quot;\%F&quot;`
@weekly /usr/sbin/zfs snapshot -r <A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">Data at AutoW-</A>`date +&quot;\%Y-\%U&quot;`
@monthly /usr/sbin/zfs snapshot -r <A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">Data at AutoM-</A>`date +&quot;\%Y-\%m&quot;`
@yearly /usr/sbin/zfs snapshot -r <A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">Data at AutoY-</A>`date +&quot;\%Y&quot;`
# do a spot of housecleaning - somewhat assumes the daily ones have run ..
@hourly /usr/sbin/zfs list -t snapshot -o name | /usr/bin/grep
<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">Data at AutoH-</A> | /usr/bin/sort -r | tail -n +26 | /usr/bin/xargs -n 1
/usr/sbin/zfs destroy
@daily /usr/sbin/zfs list -t snapshot -o name | /usr/bin/grep
<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">Data at AutoD-</A> | /usr/bin/sort -r | tail -n +9 | /usr/bin/xargs -n 1
/usr/sbin/zfs destroy
@weekly /usr/sbin/zfs list -t snapshot -o name | /usr/bin/grep
<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">Data at AutoW-</A> | /usr/bin/sort -r | tail -n +7 | /usr/bin/xargs -n 1
/usr/sbin/zfs destroy
@monthly /usr/sbin/zfs list -t snapshot -o name | /usr/bin/grep
<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">Data at AutoM-</A> | /usr/bin/sort -r | tail -n +14 | /usr/bin/xargs -n 1
/usr/sbin/zfs destroy

The bad:
* I've had one kernel panic. Mind you, that's on a fresh (i.e. buggy)
MacBook Pro and the graphics card had several glitches. Not sure if it
was ZFS related, but I sent the report in anyway.
* No friendly GUI Mac support. Hey, I smell a business idea ...

The ugly:
* NFS mounting. Really, don't do it. Well, I say that - but the
alternative (AFP) is worse. I'd say that ZFS is great for single
machine systems at the moment - the ability to create nested data
structures is great, especially for the automated backups (above).
** But as my last post indicated (to my lack of knowledge, really)
each ZFS FS needs its own entry in /etc/exports. With a lot of file
systems, that's a problem - and given that ZFS encourages a lot of
file systems, it's a big issue. Worse still is the zfs share (or lack
thereof) support.
** Note to self; how hard could zfs share be? It's just a cat &gt;&gt;
/etc/exports and corresponding deletion for zfs unshare ...
** Client-side mounting. AutoFS doesn't really like nested automounts.
If you have static mounts (via dscl /Search -list /Mounts) then it
complains every time there's a nested level in there. you need to list
every mount point or otherwise your file system tree is more holey
than a bullet ridden swiss cheese.
** DS import and export. Could I do it? Could I buggery. Ended up
doing an ldap export and import. Sob, demise of NetInfo etc. Server
Admin isn't great ether - you can poke in a share line by line if you
have time (add opts, add tcp, add nointr, add soft, add VFSLink ...)
but imagine doing that for many file systems. Hmm, there's that
business idea again ... or maybe it's my toast burning.
** Even when you've done that, it's the three-finger salute (one
finger for Mac users, I guess) to get the automounter to *realise*
that you've managed to kick ldap into submission.
** Figure out (after reboot) that sudo automount -vc would have done the trick
** OK, you can do /net/mini/Users/alex instead. That works, but you
need to either symlink /Users/alex or put /net/mini/Users/alex in the
VFSDir record. And that goes wahoonie shaped when you try and log in
to mini, because it then says you can't local mount a networked dir,
please sod off.
** I had to buy a mini a month before they were upgraded (or
cancelled, depending on belief). Bugger. Oh well, at least it's got
4G(*) in it.

Even if you do something funky with auto_home to mount user's
directories across NFS, its still a pain to have 1 NFS export per user
(pretty much back to the bad old days of AFP) - and it pretty much
negates the ability for a user to have multiple ZFS file systems (one
for Music, one for Documents etc. with different
encryption/compression levels). Of course these would only be
manageable on the 'home' server, but remote mounting would be a
nightmare.

Anyway, I thought I'd share my impressions with everyone on the list
and hope the set of crontab magic incarnations is useful. I'll be
blogging about it tomorrow via
<A HREF="http://alblue.blogspot.com/search/label/zfs">http://alblue.blogspot.com/search/label/zfs</A> which would be a good
canonical URL to bookmark for the above crontab entries

(*) Yes, it is possible to stick 4G in a mini. You just have to take
it gently and use plenty of lube. I bought a Crucial jobby
(<A HREF="http://www.crucial.com/store/partspecs.aspx?IMODULE=CT2KIT25664AC667">http://www.crucial.com/store/partspecs.aspx?IMODULE=CT2KIT25664AC667</A>).
Note that whilst you can shove 4G where the sun don't shine, and it
says 4G in warm fluffy letters on the 'About' box, the intel chipset
on board can only see ~3G of it:
mini$ sysctl -a | grep mem
hw.physmem = 2147483648
hw.usermem = 1125699584
hw.memsize = 4294967296
PhysMem:  975M wired,  431M active,  113M inactive, 2548M used, 1548M free.

Heck, still gives me a good Gb of space for ZFS's nefarious caching
needs and leaves plenty left over for a trip down memory lane. And
with my latest hourly snapshot complete, I'm going to retire for the
evening...
