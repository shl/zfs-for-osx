<PRE>Hi,

I'm running into some stability issues with ZFS on OS X, and I was
wondering whether anyone could shed some light on them.

I have a SATA drive array (Sonnet Fusion D500P) connected to a
fully-patched MBP with zfs-119 over an Expresscard/34 adapter (Sonnet
Tempo card, Sil3132 chipset I believe).  I've had kernel panics occur
both when creating a raidz1 on the array, and during moderate I/O.  I've
looked over the known issues, but I don't think I've run into any of
them.

What is strange is that zfs doesn't seem to play well with another
external drive attached to the machine (over USB2).  For instance, I was
not able to place GPT labels on the drives in the array without killing
the machine until I unmounted the USB drive.  After that, however, I was
able to create a zpool and filesystems as normal.

Later, though, the machine died when I remounted the USB drive and tried
to transfer data from that drive to the array using rsync.

Does anyone have any ideas on what might be causing this?
