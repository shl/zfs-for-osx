<PRE>	I am having issues when doing a zpool scrub on my raidz setup. My  
setup is configured of 5 1TB drives in a raidz configuration. They are  
housed in a 5 drive bay esata enclosure that uses a port multiplier.  
After doing the latest mac updates for 10.5.5 i.e. security update, it  
seems that when doing a scrub on the raidz, it will hang. It will hang  
from 26+%. It hung at one point at 46% and another time at 51% and so  
on. I have never had an issue when doing a scrub. Is anyone else  
having any problems? Could it be the security update?

	As mentioned above, I am running on Mac OS 10.5.5. The hardware is a  
G5 dual 1.8 with 2.5GB of ram. The hangs that I am describing are the  
finder will freeze up, but I can still load up applications that are  
not finder specific. I can not issue any zfs or zpool commands and I  
can not list the contents of the raidz pool with the command line  
prompt. I have not received any kernel panics. The only way for me to  
reboot the machine is by holding down the power button on the G5.  
Finder will not reboot correctly. I have looked at the logs and do not  
see anything suspicious.

	Can anyone give me any suggestions? Is there anything I can do to  
grab more data to help me solve this problem? Everything seems to be  
fine. For example, I can read the data fine or copy data to the pool  
fine, but when doing a scrub it will hang up.

Thanks for any help that can be provided,

Garrett Power
