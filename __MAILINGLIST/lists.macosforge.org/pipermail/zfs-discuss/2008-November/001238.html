<PRE>Hi All,

I've totally fallen in love with ZFS.  I started on OpenSolaris and  
have migrated to using it on OS X.  As we all have seen things aren't  
quite there yet with OS X / Finder integration and there are  
definitely bugs with interaction with DiskUtility.

Anyway, I am trying to figure out the best way to backup or replicate  
(yes, I know the difference) my storage pool. I have 4x 320GB Seagate  
7200.10 drives.  I also have 3x USB Seagate 250 GB drives.  These have  
given me nothing but headache and won't stay connected, so they have  
been deemed unreliable for ZFS (sigh - I was hoping to use these as a  
backup for the main pool.)

1 - OS X &amp; 2 HFS+ partitions
2,3,4 - ZFS raidz pool

I would like to pickup a 1TB drive and increase my storage space and  
redundancy by:
a. converting the raidz pool to a striped pool and mirror it onto the  
1TB drive (3x320 stripe + 1TB mirror of the stripe)
b. Keep the raidz pool as is and do replication of that pool onto the  
1TB drive as a separate 1 drive zfs &quot;pool&quot;
c. Go crazy and use NexentaSTOR on a VM to export the storage with  
iSCSI and have a real HFS+ volume on the Mac (I actually did this, but  
performance is abysmal.  Average of 5MB/s writes and peaks at about  
20MB/s.  Reads are no faster.)

Since snapshots aren't fully baked in OS X yet, I think the easiest  
thing would be option a.  (Feedback welcome! I haven't played with  
snapshots yet) but I can't figure how how to do a mirror of a stripe.

I'm also considering buying another small SATA drive for OS X so I  
would have 4x 320GB for a pool.

Basically my question is: what is a good, simple backup or replication  
plan for this scenario?

Thoughts?
Aaron
