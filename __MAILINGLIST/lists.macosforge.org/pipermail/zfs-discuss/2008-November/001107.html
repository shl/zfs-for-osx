<PRE>I have run into a couple of problems with ACLs on ZFS using the r119  
binaries.  The first two were brought up by Brad Allred back in  
September, but he didn't get a response and I am hoping something has  
changed since then.

1. ACLs don't inherit.
Despite setting the aclmode and aclinherit attributes to  
&quot;passthrough&quot;, there is no change in behavior.  This makes managing  
ACLs on ZFS volumes extremely frustrating and almost completely  
eliminates their value except for files and folders that will never  
change.  Which is an edge case.  It would be nice if it worked for the  
common case.


2. Group ACEs don't work.
Brad says this broke with the 10.5.5 update.  Here some additional  
details:
Group ACEs get resolved to their group ID and then resolved to a  
user.  If a user has the same UID as the GID, the ACE will be applied  
as that user.  If there is no user with that group id, an ACE gets  
added with GUID (not GID; no &quot;user:&quot; or &quot;group:&quot; at the beginning)  
&quot;FFFFEEEE-DDDD-CCCC-BBBB-AAAA00000000&quot; with the last zeros replaced  
with the GID in hex.
For example:
I have a group named local_group with GID 1025.
I have a user named local_user with UID 1025.
I apply an ACE of &quot;local_group allow write&quot; via chmod or through the  
Server Admin GUI and the file has an ACE of &quot;user:local_user allow  
write&quot;.
I remove the ACE and delete the local user local_user.
I apply an ACE of &quot;local_group allow write&quot; and the file has an ACE of  
&quot;FFFFEEEE-DDDD-CCCC-BBBB-AAAA00000401&quot;.

So there are two problems.  First, it tries to resolve GIDs into  
UIDs.  Second, it doesn't associate the group's GUID with the ACE, but  
rather tries to generate one using the group's GID.


3. Inheritance attributes can't be set on files via chmod.
Inheritance attributes don't apply to files, but you can still set  
them.  For example, setting an ACE of &quot;local_user allow  
file_inheritance&quot; on a file will create an ACE of &quot;user:local_user  
allow &quot;.  So an ACE is still set, but it is blank.  On HFS+, one can  
do this via chmod or the Server Admin GUI.  On ZFS volumes, one can do  
this via the Server Admin GUI, but not via chmod.  Instead, chmod  
produces the error &quot;chmod: Failed to set ACL on file 'test.txt':  
Invalid argument&quot;.  This is problematic because it prevents  
recursively setting permissions on directories if you want to set any  
inheritance attributes.  It is interesting that the Server Admin GUI  
acts exactly the same with ZFS, including creating empty ACEs on files.
For example:
I may want to set a directory to allow a user to read, write, and  
append to it and all sub-directories and files.  On HFS+, I can just  
use 'chmod -R +a &quot;local_user allow  
read,write,append,file_inherit,directory_inherit&quot; my_directory'.  If I  
try that on a ZFS directory, I will get the aforementioned error on  
the first file encountered and it will die.  This makes it more  
difficult to set inheritance attributes on directories.  Given that  
inheritance doesn't actually work, I suppose this is academic, but  
when that does get fixed, it would be nice if they were easy to set  
from the command line.


What is the status of ZFS on Leopard?  Given the lack of an update in  
4 months, I'm worried that it has been abandoned.  I understand that a  
lot of attention is being focused on 10.6, but it would be nice if we  
could at least get some source updates.  What if 10.5.6 breaks  
something more critical that group ACEs on ZFS?  Is there any  
commitment to this going forward or should I cross my figures that no  
security updates breaks something until 10.6 arrives?  Should I be  
filing Radar bugs for the issues above?  Should I create new tickets  
on the MacOS Forge site?

Cheers,
Nathan Florea
