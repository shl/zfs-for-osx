<PRE>I have noticed that there have been a number of references to this  
list for odd behavior surrounding directory creation/deletion.  
Specifically MacPorts build failures and trouble with phantom  
directories that won't allow themselves to be deleted.

Adding to that list is another odd occurrence that seems to be  
related. In a rather full directory hierarchy I have found that doing  
an rm -rf will sometimes generate the following:

rm: AddOns/FuBar_TopScoreFu/Libs: Directory not empty
rm: AddOns/FuBar_TopScoreFu: Directory not empty
rm: AddOns: Directory not empty

Odd since the force option shouldn't generate many complaints and of  
course the recurse option should be getting children before parents.

Doing the same rm -rf a second time a bit later succeeds fine.

I first noticed this when trying to remove the contents of .Trashes.  
In that case a couple of repeated (rather impatiently) rm -rf got the  
same errors. Manually checking each of the directories with ls, then  
repeating the rm -rf worked fine.

I can see this being a problem with any utility that rapidly creates  
and destroys directories/files and isn't diligent about testing for  
errors.

So two questions. Is this a known issue? If it isn't is there anything  
specific that might help track it down from a debugging perspective  
that I could provide.

Thanks

-Jon
