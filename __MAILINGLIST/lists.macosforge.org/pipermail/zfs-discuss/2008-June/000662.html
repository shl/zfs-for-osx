Cool, interesting link!

Hardware acceleration is always interesting, but often the overhead of  
going off-CPU swamps any performance gain.

It's totally application-dependent.

  For ZFS disk operations, I suspect that you'll usually want to stay  
on-CPU, or have a CPU core dedicated to ZFS tasks. You used to see  
that sort of thing with Ethernet &quot;offload engines&quot;, where the Ethernet  
NIC is pre-processing things for you. But that's very dependent on the  
device driver, which is tied to the OS implementation...  now that  
multi-core CPUs are standard, you are far better off with thread-core  
affinit (letting the OS keep the I/O operations on one of the CPU  
cores).

About five years ago I played with an AES encryption engine chip and  
FreeBSD -- it used the chip to generate *really* random numbers to / 
dev/random, and could use the engine as the system's AES  
implementation. (OpenSSL has similar support for plug-in drivers in  
user-space.) Using this thing for full-disk encryption, I maybe saw a  
performance *hit*, maybe no difference: the throughput was still  
limited by disk I/O. Great. Curiously, I didn't notice any reduction  
in CPU utilization. Using the thing as an entropy pool for /dev/random  
was *great*, though: it never ran out of entropy, you never had to  
wait! So that was cool. But the encryption part was a disappointment.

Such limitations may *not* apply to *on-CPU* implementations of AES:  
you see good results with VIA C7 chips, for example. So much so that  
Intel will add AES-specific instructions to SSE4 -- which are  
incompatible with the VIA implementation. Oy. (Google &quot;Intel AVX&quot; for  
near-term, &quot;Westmere AES-NI&quot; for next year's version.)


That's not to say that we shouldn't be excited about OpenCL.  I work  
on an application that can really use the parallelism; we have a data- 
cube gridding stage that has seen 100x performance improvements when  
ported to a GPU. We've stayed out of that game for our desktop  
application because things are changing too rapidly for us to devote  
much scientist time to it: something like OpenCL couldn't come at a  
better time for us.
