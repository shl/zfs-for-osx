</I>
The disk still shows up and is listed as having a ZFS partition at s2  
as expected. OS X has a habit of changing the dev disk number across  
reboots so it is hard to say which slice was really missing. As you  
can see from the zpool status the missing disk9 is reported online in  
another slice, but one of 8 is AWOL.

&gt;<i> What I did was reformat doing the following...
</I>&gt;<i> diskutil partitiondisk /dev/disk9 GPTFormat ZFS %noformat% 100%
</I>&gt;<i> rebooted to make sure that everything saw the disk9s2 slice (for  
</I>&gt;<i> lack of

</I>&gt;<i> little of the drive, but it discovered quickly that the majority of  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> data was still there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I could partition the device that is an orphan however it doesn't help  
me replace the slice in the raidz since it has a bogus identifier.

&gt;<i> That was my case anyhow... wish you the best, cause it my case

</I>&gt;<i> Still not certain what caused it thou, maybe my HighPoint

</I>&gt;<i> don't really know...
</I>
The issue seems to be a bit more benign that I expected since after a  
reboot everything was showing up again. I think it might be a race  
condition with the devices showing up at various times on boot.  
Sometimes the pool is degraded, sometimes it is okay. A scrub easily  
updates the slice that was offline.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On another note, please don't think that I'm trying to tell you how to
</I>&gt;<i> setup your system, but for more than 5 drives raidz2 is recommended,  
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> if you are already aware, then you know what you are doing and you can
</I>&gt;<i> ignore me ;) I myself and running 5 raidz1, so i'm breaking the &quot;rule&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> too, just not as much :)
</I>
In this case the 8 devices are each 10 TB raid 6 hardware devices. The  
raidz of the raid 6 hardware devices gives a usable space of 70 TB  
with better than average reliability. The issue with 8 devices in this  
case is more than likely a performance one and not of particular  
concern in this application. I would be happy to provide more  
technical details if there is any interest.
