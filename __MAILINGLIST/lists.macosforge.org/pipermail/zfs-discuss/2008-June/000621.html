<PRE>Hi there,

In May, Donald Campbell II delurked on this list to suggest that Apple
might want to take a long look at including a much-requested feature
in ZFS, even though Sun itself is too focused on the enterprise to
care: The ability to add one disk at a time to configurations such as
RAID-Z. I'd like to follow him into the sunlight to second that. For
us normal people with normal budgets, this is a show-stopper.

However, I was wondering if it might be easier for Apple to provide an
external tool to do this first instead of trying to include it as an
intrinsic feature of ZFS. That is, include a utility that you use by
taking the existing RAID (or pool or whatever) offline to add the
drive. This would be decidedly less cool, but it would avoid breaking
with Sun, wouldn't make the ZFS code itself more complex, and would
give Apple's ZFS an advantage over ZFS on Solaris or OpenBSD.

For the record, I think Sun is making a serious mistake by shrugging
this feature off as unimportant. I just put together a home server
(the usual storage for iMovies of the kids chasing the cat), and I
played around with Solaris for a while during the planing stage. Yes,
ZFS made me drool, but in the end, I picked Ubuntu because you can
expand Linux RAID-5 systems with mdadm but can't &quot;grow&quot; RAID-Z systems
with Solaris.

Anyway. Thanks for the great work porting ZFS, there are a lot of
people out here just dying to get it running on their Macs, even
without RAID.

Y, Scot
