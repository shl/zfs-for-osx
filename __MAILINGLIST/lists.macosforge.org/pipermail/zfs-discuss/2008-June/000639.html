<PRE>Hi,

I have a pool on a set of three USB-disks. It is attached to a Mac Mini
running with Mac OS X 10.5.3 and ZFS 111. Currently the pool is  
degraded.
Zpool status produces the following:

   pool: re
  state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices could not be used because the label is  
missing or
	invalid.  Sufficient replicas exist for the pool to continue
	functioning in a degraded state.
action: Replace the device using 'zpool replace'.
    see: <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-4J">http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-4J</A>
  scrub: resilver completed with 0 errors on Sun Jun 15 13:23:39 2008
config:

	NAME                      STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
	re                        DEGRADED     0     0     0
	  raidz1                  DEGRADED     0     0     0
	    disk1s2               ONLINE       0     0     0
	    disk2s2               ONLINE       0     0     0
	    11495588248848248386  FAULTED      0     0     0  was /dev/disk1s2

errors: No known data errors

I'm not able to perform any actions because the faulted disk doesn't
have a proper name, just a number. I don't think by the way the disk
itself is faulted, because it is only a few months old and it is being
contacted during the boot cycle. I rather suspect the USB-link, though
I have no prove for it.

This is the second time it happens. The first time the disk came back
after a strange sequence of events. At some point I power off the disk
and back on. The OS froze because of this. After a reboot there was no
pool anymore. Then I did a shutdown and powered off everything. After
the boot all three disks were online again, but the day after I was
again in the same situation.

I have also tried switching the USB-ports as well as removing the USB- 
hub.
It doesn't change anything.

Does anyone have an idea about what causes this and how I can recover
from the situation?

Best regards,

Werner.
