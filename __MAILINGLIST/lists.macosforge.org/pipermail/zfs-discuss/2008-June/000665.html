I've discussed the performance and limitations of the various crypto  
chipsets with Sam Leffler over the years,
mostly as a side-discussion to our continuing discourse on things  
802.11.

Sam is the author of most, if not all of the crypto drivers in FreeBSD.

He's pretty 'down' on many (but not all!) implementations, so it could  
just be that you picked the wrong one.

But back to ZFS.  A crypto offload engine might be useful when we get  
a crypto layer for ZFS.   This already works
in FreeBSD, where the GEOM layer allows stacking in the filesystem,  
under (over?) ZFS.

As for checksum offloading, I doubt you're going to want to use the  
vector registers (SSE3) for that, due to the overhead of loading/ 
unloading them
for every context switch, and not everyone has a GPU supported by  
OpenCL (much less factoring in the issues with moving the data to/from  
the GPU.)
