<PRE>(I sent this from the wrong address previously).

UPDATE: I think I have found a way to solve the confusion. I did a  
zpool export tank and then zpool import tank. It's now showing the  
offline disk as disk5s2, so hopefully I can sort everything out now.

---ORIGINAL MESSAGE BELOW---

Hi,

I have a zpool that looks like this:-

legion:~ david$ zpool status tank
  pool: tank
state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices has been taken offline by the administrator.
	Sufficient replicas exist for the pool to continue functioning in a
	degraded state.
action: Online the device using 'zpool online' or replace the device  
with
	'zpool replace'.
scrub: resilver completed with 0 errors on Tue Mar 24 23:24:52 2009
config:

	NAME         STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
	tank         DEGRADED     0     0     0
	  mirror     DEGRADED     0     0     0
	    disk4s2  ONLINE       0     0     0
	    disk1s2  ONLINE       0     0     0
	    disk4s2  OFFLINE      0     0     0

errors: No known data errors

So I have a single mirrored vdev which is a 3-way mirror except that  
one of the devices has been taken offline. Said device was disk4s2,  
but now there is another disk4s2 (the top one) which is online. The  
OFFLINE disk4s2 is presently attached as disk5s2.

When I do 'zpool online disk4s2' the status shows 'resilver in  
progress' for about a minute or less but the status remains as above  
with only 2 disks online. This is exactly the same thing that happens  
if I online disk1s2 (even though it's already online). This suggests  
that it's onlining the currently online disk4s2 rather than the  
offline disk (now disk5s2).

Another strange thing is that I can't seem to offline either disk4s2  
or disk1s2:-
	cannot offline disk1s2: no valid replicas
Surely I should be able to offline all but one disk in the mirror?  
(I'm sure I have before). Is something confused?

Disk devices being renamed doesn't normally seem to confuse ZFS, but I  
can't find a way to specify the offline disk. Isn't there supposed to  
be some kind of disk ID that ZFS puts on there, which is why it knows  
that the offline disk4s2 is distinct from the online one? In which  
case how do I find and specify this?


Thanks,
-- David
