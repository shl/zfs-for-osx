<PRE>Hi,

Mark from Softraid has just sent out some info about Softraid 4.0.

&gt;<i> SoftRAID 4.0 should be out in about 1-2 months. It will be a paid  
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade, $69 US.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has many new features and we are excited to get SoftRAID 4 out to  
</I>&gt;<i> the market.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SoftRAID 4 will include:
</I>&gt;<i> Snow Leopard, and 64 bit, compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> Fast Mirror rebuilds
</I>&gt;<i> Snapshot backup disks
</I>&gt;<i> Disk Certification
</I>&gt;<i> Data Validation
</I>&gt;<i> Email Notification
</I>&gt;<i> Command line interface
</I>&gt;<i> Automatic Software update
</I>&gt;<i> Smart Error reporting
</I>&gt;<i> Misc. error notification (busy CPU, full volume, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> and more!
</I>

Something tells me that SoftRaid just dumped their future kext  
development and now specialise in building front-ends to cmd-line  
binaries...  ;))

Cheers

Raoul

&quot;... The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste, they  
have absolutely no taste and what that means is, and I don't mean that  
in a small way, I mean that in a big way.
In the sense that: they, they don't think of original ideas, and they  
don't bring much culture into their product.
And you say why is that important? well proportionally spaced fonts  
come from typesetting and beautiful books, that's where one gets the  
idea.  If it weren't for the mac they would never have that in their  
products.
And, so I guess I am saddened, not by Microsoft's success, I have no  
problem with their success. They've earned their success; for the most  
part.
I have a problem with the fact that they make just really third grade  
products ...&quot;
