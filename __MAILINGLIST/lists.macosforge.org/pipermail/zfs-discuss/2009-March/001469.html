<PRE> From what I understand of the ARC logic it's limited to read caching  
first off, so the effect of copying data to your volumes will not  
result in the data being loaded into ARC. Following that, there's some  
internal logic about identifying both frequently solicited data (MFU)  
and current working data (MRU) - it doesn't just load up the ARC cache  
unless there appears to be some compelling reason to do so.  It's not  
just a straight MRU (Most Recently Used) like older caching models.  
For example, streaming reads are generally not put into ARC since you  
are better served going directly to disk instead of overwriting  
currently cached data which has (probably) more value in cache based  
on usage history.

It's also a dynamic cache so when the OS imposes memory pressure by  
requesting memory assignment to other processes, the cache will shrink  
and OS X can be pretty aggressive about consuming memory for it's own  
caching purposes. You'd need to be reading in 3Gb of data from disk to  
get it into the cache in the first place, assuming your machine wasn't  
doing anything else at all that required any memory.

A more detailed summary can be found at:
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/5329-Some-insight-into-the-read-cache-of-ZFS-or-The-ARC.html">http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/5329-Some-insight-into-the-read-cache-of-ZFS-or-The-ARC.html</A> 
 &gt;

I'm not sure if there any specific tuning parameters applied to the  
current OS X implementation.

Cheers,

Erik
