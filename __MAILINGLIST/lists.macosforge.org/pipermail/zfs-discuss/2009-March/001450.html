<PRE>+ Chris Ruiz &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">chris at young-alumni.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> If you want to share the pool between operating systems, you need 
</I>&gt;<i> to 'zpool export pool' on osx and 'zpool import -f pool' on 
</I>&gt;<i> freebsd.  Never forget to export your pool, especially if you are 
</I>&gt;<i> using removable media.  You will need to use -f with import because 
</I>&gt;<i> the last system that used the pool is not the system trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> import the pool.
</I>
That is not right: You can definitely import the pool without the -f 
flag. The point of -f is that it allows you to import a pool that has 
not been properly exported. Without it, you would lose all the data 
in the pool if the host dies while the pool is active and cannot be 
revived. That this would be bad must surely be an understatement.

There is another gotcha with sharing between osx and freebsd, though, 
and that is associated with ACLs. On one such pool that I share 
regularly, new files created on the OSX side get created with an ACL 
that is interpreted on the freebsd side as &quot;no access&quot;. So I end up 
with files that I own (I use the same uid on both machines), with 
mode -rw-r--r-- that I still cannot read. Doing chmod +t followed by 
chmod -t on the files as root on the freebsd side cures the problem, 
but it's a bother. I haven't found the time to investigate the 
problem properly yet.
