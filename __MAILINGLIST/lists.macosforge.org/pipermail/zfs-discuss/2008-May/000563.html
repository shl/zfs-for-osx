<PRE>While testing my mirrored pool I decided to unplug the power for one  
of the firewire drives while I was updating some data on the  
filesystem.  I expected the pool status/health to change from &quot;ONLINE&quot;  
to &quot;DEGRADED&quot; it did not.  Both drives in the mirror remained listed  
as &quot;ONLINE&quot;.  But then I noticed &quot;zpool status&quot; saying:

scott-palmers-imac:~ scott$ zpool status
   pool: tank
  state: ONLINE
status: One or more devices has experienced an unrecoverable error.  An
	attempt was made to correct the error.  Applications are unaffected.
action: Determine if the device needs to be replaced, and clear the  
errors
	using 'zpool clear' or replace the device with 'zpool replace'.
    see: <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-9P">http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-9P</A>
  scrub: none requested
config:

	NAME         STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
	tank         ONLINE       0     0     0
	  mirror     ONLINE       0     0     0
	    disk1s2  ONLINE       0     0     0
	    disk2s2  ONLINE   6.43K 33.9K     0

errors: No known data errors


Huh?  Unrecoverable error?  I thought ZFS was all about recovering.

After I finished writing my data, I powered on the other drive.  But  
that changed nothing.  That status never changed.  I expected a  
&quot;resilver&quot;.

I noticed that  after powering on the drive it appears as disk3, not  
disk2... does that mean that ZFS isn't seeing it?

What am I missing?  Wasn't I testing exactly the sort of thing that  
ZFS is supposed handle automatically?

It looks like I will need to run &quot;zpool replace&quot; to force the  
resilver. Right?

Scott
