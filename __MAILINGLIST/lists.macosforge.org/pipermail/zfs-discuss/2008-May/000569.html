&gt;<i> Huh?  Unrecoverable error?  I thought ZFS was all about recovering.

</I>&gt;<i> Scott,
</I>&gt;<i>  The error message needs to be read a certain way. The &quot;unrecoverable
</I>&gt;<i> error&quot; is correct, but realize that it is only referring to ZFS being
</I>&gt;<i> aware that there was a problem with the underlying hardware. Reading
</I>&gt;<i> further note that &quot;applications are unaffected&quot;, implying that ZFS is
</I>&gt;<i> still confident that all your data is correct, despite the hardware
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>

I realize that ZFS was happily using the other drive in the mirror and the
data was still there.  But certainly the condition should have read
&quot;degraded&quot; since the protection of a mirror was NOT in place at that time.
The powered down drive certainly should NOT have read as ONLINE.  I
shouldn't have to manually take the drive off-line if it isn't even
accessible.  (E.g. normally for a mounted volume, OS X will raise a stink
that you've disconnected a device that wasn't properly unmounted.. I
understand that there should be no in-you-face pop-up -- but simply mention
this because it indicates at some level the system should be aware of the
missing drive pretty much immediately.)


Also, when watching the ZFS self-healing videos and such online I
&gt;<i> recall that ZFS doesn't do background checks (excluding a scrub) that
</I>&gt;<i> all the devices are still there or that the data is correct. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, if you dd zero's randomly across a mirror, ZFS will report that
</I>&gt;<i> everything is good until it reads the data in, realizes that one of the
</I>&gt;<i> mirrors is bad, and will use whichever mirror it need to in order to
</I>&gt;<i> pass the checksums.
</I>

That's strange.. it's not exactly a &quot;background&quot; check that is needed since
the writes are obviously failing.  Is it so disconnected that ZFS isn't
being told of the physical write errors - in the same manner that it is
returning success to the application level?


I can't say exactly why after thousands of errors it didn't flag the
&gt;<i> pool as degraded,
</I>

Right... Do you agree that it should have?


Scott
