Scott,
   The error message needs to be read a certain way. The &quot;unrecoverable
error&quot; is correct, but realize that it is only referring to ZFS being
aware that there was a problem with the underlying hardware. Reading
further note that &quot;applications are unaffected&quot;, implying that ZFS is
still confident that all your data is correct, despite the hardware
problems.

   Also, when watching the ZFS self-healing videos and such online I
recall that ZFS doesn't do background checks (excluding a scrub) that
all the devices are still there or that the data is correct. For
example, if you dd zero's randomly across a mirror, ZFS will report that
everything is good until it reads the data in, realizes that one of the
mirrors is bad, and will use whichever mirror it need to in order to
pass the checksums.

   I can't say exactly why after thousands of errors it didn't flag the
pool as degraded, but never was ZFS uncertain about the data integrity
on the remaining drive, hence, applications being unaffected. It could
be an artifact of the Mac OS X implementation vs the Sun implementation.

   As far as replacing the drive and having to go through a few steps, I
will say that it isn't as easy as it could be, particularly on the Mac.
Personally, I found that restarting my system was best when doing drive
changes, but that might be caused by the highpoint RAID card I am using
which has horrid hot-swap support.
