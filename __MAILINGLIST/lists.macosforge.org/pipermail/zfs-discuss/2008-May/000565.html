It does.  Though I was under the impression that I wouldn't need to  
manually kick off the healing.  I think it was someone blogging about  
how wonderful it was to use ZFS on their (Solaris) laptop so that they  
would automatically get a backup by plugging in their external drive  
when they get back from a trip.

I tried &quot;zpool scrub tank&quot; *before* rebooting, and that finally caused  
the status to transition from online to:

scott-palmers-imac:~ scott$ zpool status -xv
   pool: tank
  state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices could not be opened.  Sufficient replicas  
exist for
	the pool to continue functioning in a degraded state.
action: Attach the missing device and online it using 'zpool online'.

  scrub: resilver in progress, 0.10% done, 0h33m to go

I don't understand why ZFS didn't enter that state automatically when  
I powered down the drive in the first place.

Though no resilvering appears to be happening yet.. despite the  
&quot;resilver in progress, 0.10% done, 0h33m to go&quot;  After some time the  
status still states:

scott-palmers-imac:~ scott$ zpool status -xv
   pool: tank
  state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices could not be opened.  Sufficient replicas  
exist for
	the pool to continue functioning in a degraded state.

I have to get ZFS to see the &quot;new&quot; device somehow.  Considering all  
the scalability fuss about adding drives to a live ZFS pool I find it  
hard to believe that a reboot is truly needed.

Using the 'action' from the above status output I tried just for kicks:

scott-palmers-imac:~ scott$ zpool online tank disk3s2
cannot online disk3s2: no such device in pool

which is what I expected.

The zpool man page doesn't mention spares in relation to &quot;replace&quot; (or  
&quot;attach&quot;, &quot;detach&quot;), that's why I thought it would be the right thing  
to do.:

        zpool replace [-f] pool old_device [new_device]

            Replaces  old_device with new_device. This is equivalent  
to attach-
            ing new_device, waiting for it  to  resilver,  and  then   
detaching
            old_device.


I decided to manually do the attach/detach in two steps and it appears  
to work.  I didn't need to add the device as a spare.  Though this  
time I gave the entire device to ZFS instead of the single ZFS slice  
that was on it.  I suspect that wasn't the right thing to do.. since  
ZFS probably wouldn't see the old slice that belonged to the mirror in  
the first place when I did it that way.
