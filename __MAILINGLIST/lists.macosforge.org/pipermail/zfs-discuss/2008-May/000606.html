<PRE>Hi Noel,

Thank you for the zpool iostats command.  Very nice to see what's  
actually
going on.
I ran the command, but it has raised another question that I'm  
scratching
my head over, here is some sample output of iostat.


#sudo zpool iostat bigboxraidz 1

bigboxraidz   880G   980G    207    209  24.6M  2.14M

Using a MacPro, the stats above were observed by mounting the share
&quot;LoungeRoomMac&quot; which resides on the bigboxraidz pool via Appleshare
(gigabit).

So, I understand that the zpool is being read at an average of around
30MB/sec...

But when I look at actual network transfer speeds via MenuMeters for
example, it only shows a transfer speed of approximately 3-5MB/sec..

This I don't understand.

iostat is saying 30MB/sec reads, but Menumeters is only showing 5Mb/sec
maximum. (the 5Mb/sec is about right when calculating the time it took  
to
transfer a 1GB VOB file)

I have a screenshot of this at: <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/tangles/zfs.html">http://homepage.mac.com/tangles/zfs.html</A>

Cheers,

Raoul



 &gt;It could be that what you're witnessing is ZFS's transactional IO
 &gt;syncing.  Basically we write to disk (ie sync a transaction group)
 &gt;every five seconds, hence this likely explains your crazy drive light
 &gt;issue.
 &gt;
 &gt;To actually see what's going on down there, I'd recommend running this
 &gt;on the command line in a terminal window:
 &gt;
 &gt;  #sudo zpool iostat bigboxraidz 1
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;This will give you all the specs on what I/O ZFS is doing every
 &gt;second.  How many reads, how many writes, and the size of each
 &gt;respectively. And will keep going until you ctl-C it.
 &gt;
