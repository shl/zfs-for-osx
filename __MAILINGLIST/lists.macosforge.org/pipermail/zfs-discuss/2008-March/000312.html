<PRE>As of this morning when I sent this (before leaving for work and after  
the system was up for 8 hours) I had the following

Lumiere:~ kane$ zpool import -af
cannot import 'zfsMirror': invalid vdev configuration

as the only message.

I just got home and tried again and got the following

Lumiere:~ kane$ zpool import
   pool: zfsMirror
     id: 5643149568963753982
  state: FAULTED
action: The pool cannot be imported due to damaged devices or data.
config:

	zfsMirror                 UNAVAIL  insufficient replicas
	  raidz1                  UNAVAIL  corrupted data
	    disk7s2               ONLINE
	    disk8s2               ONLINE
	    disk12s2              ONLINE
	    10120111723985263653  ONLINE
	    disk6s2               ONLINE


So the system is currently offline and not working.

I have no idea what 10120111723985263653 is. When things were working  
this was just a normal disk?s? name.

Looking at my list of drives with diskutil list it appears that the  
following is this weird numbered drive
/dev/disk10
    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE        
IDENTIFIER
    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *279.5 Gi    
disk10
    1:                        EFI                         200.0 Mi    
disk10s1
    2:                        ZFS zfsMirror               279.1 Gi    
disk10s2


The pool only ever had these 5 disks in it.


When I created the pool I used the slice names


Is there a way to recover from this fubarred state?

Also, a little more info that may or may not be important. All my  
drives are in an external firewire mega case. One of the the drives  
for a normal apple raid had died so I took the case apart, removed  
that drive and then moved another drive into its place (so it was  
connected elsewhere in the firewire ide chain). It was one of the  
drives from this pool. But after that was done I booted up and the  
pool showed up and everything worked as normal without any issues that  
I am aware of. It wasnt until a few restarts later that I had the  
crash that has me in the current situation.

Everything on this pool is mirrored on another raid, so I can easily  
just destroy and recreate it. But I want to make sure there is no  
other useful info I can give you before I do.

Thanks,
Kane
