<PRE>Hi,
as I understood it, for now you can.
1. add vdevs (raidz or mirrored, or even simply drives or files if you  
don't care about your data)
2. swap out all disks in a vdev with larger ones. The capacity of   
vdev is currently determined by the smallest device.
if you have 8 disks in a raidz1 vdev you'll have roughly 7*(capacity  
of the smallest disk), if you use raidz2, its 6*(capacity of the  
smallest disk)
As far as I understood the zfs-team is working on methods to do more  
flexible re-organization of pools, since for normal operations you  
basicly need the double (triple) capacity to do zfs send and receive  
of the data in order to rearrange drives.

However the good news is, there is no need to export and import the  
pool to see the capacity grow. ZFS performs all maintenance operations  
online.
(This is just for clarification - I'd rather have a offline &quot;Alter  
vdev&quot; tool than nothing, although in the long run it will be very nice  
to &quot;evacuate&quot; ,restripe, etc disks/vdevs while working online.)
Hope this helps,
	ralf
PS:  No&#235;l or anyone with special access. I also missed this info in  
the FAQ. Is there any timeframe as to when we are likely to see  
improvement on that situation?
