<PRE>Hi,

there has been some discussion recently about the random-read- 
performance of zraid compared to mirrored disks and raid5.
Although I am a bit late to join this party, I want to add what i  
think are the theoretical implications of the COW-design on the issue.
I have not checked the code how much the things I discuss are  
fundamental design decisions that would force big changes to  
implement, I am just hoping to get the reasoning correct.

1. Full read
The fact that ZFS always writes data in full striped across all disks  
does NOT imply it always has to read data in full stripes.
If it is only interested in a particular byte, it would &quot;know&quot; on  
which disks that byte had been written and access just that disk.
The real question is HOW does zraid distribute the data and is it does  
this prevent accessing data that happens to be on individual drives.
If it can only access all disks at once then it is not reading data  
slower, it is just reading unnecessary data.
This is however not implied by the COW design or the wasted space/ 
redundancy ratio, but only by the way low levels of zfs process read  
requests.
 From benchmark it seems, zfs is indeed reading from all disks (except  
for the parity drive), so the situation could improve a lot.

2. Performance of Mirroring vs. RAID-Z
This is a question of read vs. write performance.
a) Mirrored disks generally have the write performance of the slowest  
disk in the array.
b) raid-z will do sequential writes most of the time thereby achieving  
the performance of the slowest disk * (raid width - redundancy level)
(Note that zfs cannot completely avoid random access for random  
writes, it just moves part of it to the time the data is read, which  
might hurt some benchmarks, as you get more random reads this way).
c) streaming read performance and random read performance (if  
saturated with requests) for mirrors is the sum of all the performance  
of all disks.
d) streaming read performance for raid-z is the performance of the  
slowest disk * (raid width - redundancy level)
e) random read performance for raid-z could be the performance of the  
slowest disk * (raid width - redundancy level)
This is because raid-z can not freely choose the disk to read from, so  
chances are requests will pile up for the slowest disk and all other  
requests have to wait for that. If, infact just one disk is much  
slower to fulfill a request, the data on that disk could as well be  
recomputed from the data on all other disks. This improvement would  
have some catches, as it is unlikely and would not detect silent data  
corruption on that slow disk. Having said that, silent data corruption  
will also be undetected on mirrored drives for all drives that are no  
actively used to fulfill the request. The only way to be sure in that  
area is regular scrubbing

3. Performance implications of zfs COPIES=n
Since for many scenarios random reads occur for large number of small  
files that occupy little disk-space, it might be worthwhile placing  
extra copies of small files onto the array. This improves the chances  
that random reads are on in fact sequential for one of the copies and  
minimizes necessary head movements while also allowing to choose the  
fastest drive that has holds the requested data.
I do not know is ZFS will always try the first copy first, and the  
other ones only in case of failure, but not doing so might be a  
worthwhile idea.
This would still not help in all situations, like database serves,  
that have big files in which random reads may occur frequently.
If zfs would try to group small files and/or additional copies  
together, it could also help statistical behaviour significantly.
This works best if you have more than one vdev in your pool.

To sum it up, situation is not as grim as it seems for raid-z
raid-z can offer much better write performance combined with better  
space utilization. If things are done well, read performance is only  
slightly lower, so for many use-cases raid-z would be preferable,  
especially if you keep in mind that starting with groups of four  
disks, raidz2 offers far better fault-tolerance at the same disk- 
utilization level. As of now, this is all quite theoretic as for  
implementation details. Maybe someone who knows more of the source  
code than me can shed some light on those ideas.
