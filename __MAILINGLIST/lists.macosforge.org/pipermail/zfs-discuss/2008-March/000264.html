i think the broader point is that with the fseventd framework you're  
essentially getting incremental changes since the last full backup and  
the changes are being tracked and copied as work might be ongoing -  
this is typically fine for a simple backup strategy .. but what you're  
not getting is a point-in-time snapshot with copy-on-write  
functionality for checkpointing a filesystem like you'd get with ZFS -  
this would more advantageous for guaranteeing the atomicity of updates  
at a particular state (ie: lockfs and then snap, or making sure you've  
got database consistency)

(note: with ZFS you'll still have to clone or send after you snapshot  
to get it onto a separate pool or volume)
