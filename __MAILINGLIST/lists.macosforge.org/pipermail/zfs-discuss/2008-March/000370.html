<PRE>Hoping I can get a clear answer on this one - there seems to be  
conflicting info drifting around the intertubes. I have a RAID-Z pool  
of eight 320gb disks, whose capacity is currently about 2tb. I would  
like to increase the capacity of the pool. I understand that I can not  
add more disks to the pool, but it sounds as if I can swap out disks  
for larger ones and resilver to achieve the same end.

Initially, I thought I understood that all I had to do was swap out  
one disk and resilver, export the pool, then import it again to see  
the greater capacity. I have done this (with two disks in fact), but  
the capacity of the pool has not changed. So does this mean I need to  
swap out ALL disks in the pool for larger ones before I will see an  
increase? Can anyone say with confidence that if I shell out for six  
more 750gb drives and go through the long process of resilvering that  
I will definitely see an increase in pool size?

Thanks in advance for your help on this.
