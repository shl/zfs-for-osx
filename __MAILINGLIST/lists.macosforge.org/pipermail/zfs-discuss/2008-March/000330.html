<PRE>   What character constraints does ZFS have that 
Mac OS Extended (Journaled) does not?

   I'm trying to back up (copy) Mac OS X files to 
ZFS.  I tried to use a NAS device for this but 
ran into trouble because files with 
Macintosh-legal characters in their names 
couldn't be copied to SMB volumes.  I assumed 
that this wouldn't be a problem with ZFS, but 
unfortunately it appears that is.

   I was copying a folder to a ZFS pool (5 x 1TB, 
raidz2) and I got a Finder error (i.e., the file 
&quot;05 Not This Time.mp3&quot; can't be coped because the 
name is &quot;too long&quot; or contains &quot;characters the 
disk cannot display&quot;).  I tried again (35 MB 
total) and the Finder's &quot;Copy&quot; window stayed open 
for four hours (reporting &quot;Estimating time 
remaining...&quot;).  I was unable to quit/stop the 
Copy and had to Force Quit the Finder (which 
failed and I had to hold the Power button for 
eight seconds).

   I don't see how the names could be &quot;too long&quot;. 
The files have no more than 24 characters in 
their names (so even if every character was four 
bytes it still wouldn't be too long).  The files 
are French music titles that were looked up at 
CDDB when I ripped a music CD (and there are no 
more than two or three accented characters per 
title).  These are the folder and filenames:

Jazz a?? La Franc??aise (parent folder, a.k.a. 
&quot;Jazz\ a\314\200\ La\ Franc\314\247aise&quot;)
     01 A La Franc??aise.mp3
     02 Garnerama.mp3
     03 Bach To Swing.mp3
     04 Etude In Blue.mp3
     05 Not This Time.mp3
     06 Blue Kiss From Brazil.mp3
     07 Fiance??es En Folie.mp3

   Is the limit on the whole pathname?

/Volumes/Kate_backup_372/2008/2008_03_08/katemcjones/Music/iTunes/iTunes 
Music/Claude Bolling Trio/Jazz &#224; La Fran&#231;aise/05 
Not This Time.mp3

&gt;<i>Not quite sure exactly what kind of conventions you're referring to.  
</I>&gt;<i>In general, we export UTF-8 kNFD trough the API but store kNFC on disk.
</I>&gt;<i>There is a difference in the way names are 
</I>&gt;<i>looked up and dealt with in ZFS then HFS.  In 
</I>&gt;<i>ZFS everything is stored via hash in the ZAP 
</I>&gt;<i>which has a 256 byte limit.  HFS can store 256 
</I>&gt;<i>Unicode chars which when converted to UTF-8 can 
</I>&gt;<i>exceed 256 bytes.  Hence perhaps you have some 
</I>&gt;<i>extremely long filenames that have a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i>accented or foreign chars in your data.
