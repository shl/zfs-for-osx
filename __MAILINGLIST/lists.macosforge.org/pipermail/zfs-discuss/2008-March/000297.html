It works something like this.  You make a snapshot of your source filesystem
and then send/recv it as a full stream to your backup destination.  This
will create a new filesystem on your backup destination that has a single
snapshot.  That snapshot references all the data in the filesystem as it is
at that point in time.

Now, at a later point in time you create a new snapshot on your source
filesystem then do an incremental send/recv using that first snapshot as the
reference.  This will create a new snapshot on your destination.  That
snapshot will reference any data from the first snapshot that still exists,
plus any new data that's been added or modified between the two snapshots.
 It will not reference any data that ceased to exist between the two
snapshots (deleted files or pieces of files that have been modified).

Now, your backup filesystem has a union of all data that existed at both
points in time that the snapshots were created with the snapshots as a way
of selecting which set you want to reference.  You can keep doing this using
the previous snapshot as the reference and your backup destination will grow
by the amount of new/modified data between snapshots.

When your destination starts to fill up you can start destroying snapshots.
 When you destroy a snapshot any data that is referenced solely by that
snapshot will go away.  So, if you destroy the origninal snapshot, data that
was deleted or modified between the first and second snapshot will go away.
 All other data will stay because it's still referenced by that second
snapshot, at least.

You do not have to keep the original instance, per se, because it's only a
set of references to data blocks, in effect.  Destroying it only deletes the
data that ceased to exist between it and the second snapshot.

When you run 'zfs list' you can see how much data a snapshot &quot;references&quot;,
which is basically how much was in the filesystem at the time of the
snapshot.  You can also see how much data the snapshot &quot;uses&quot;, which is the
data that only that snapshot references.  Destroying a snapshot will only
ever delete as much data as is shown in the &quot;used&quot; column.  However, be
destroying a snapshot you may cause the &quot;used&quot; value for another snapshot to
increase if it becomes the sole remaining snapshot to reference a block of
data.
