<PRE>Hi list, hi Kane
I had similar problems during my early experiments with ZFS, but  
managed to get all my data out the pool (however, I was unable to  
fully recover it. No&#235;l attributed the problems to one of the disks not  
having an GUID partition scheme, but I am not sure that was really the  
cause of the problem.

You get the weird number because disk10 is not recognized by zfs as  
being the disk correctly, i.e. the disk/pool identifiers do not match.
What worked for me was disconnecting the disk, bringing the pool up in  
a degraded state.
Unfortunately, I was unable to add the disk later without getting a  
kenel panic on the next zpool status, so I just copied all data from  
the broken pool and started over.
AFTER rescuing all data, you might try to copy / wipe the first/last  
MB of the disk using dd. That way, zfs would probably recognize the  
identification a broken and rewrite it from the other disks. Maybe  
No&#235;l can recall my case and give you further instructions.
Hope this helps,
	ralf

&gt;<i> As of this morning when I sent this (before leaving for work and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The pool only ever had these 5 disks in it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I created the pool I used the slice names
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a way to recover from this fubarred state?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, a little more info that may or may not be important. All my  
</I>&gt;<i> drives are in an external firewire mega case. One of the the drives  
</I>&gt;<i> for a normal apple raid had died so I took the case apart, removed  
</I>&gt;<i> that drive and then moved another drive into its place (so it was  
</I>&gt;<i> connected elsewhere in the firewire ide chain). It was one of the  
</I>&gt;<i> drives from this pool. But after that was done I booted up and the  
</I>&gt;<i> pool showed up and everything worked as normal without any issues  
</I>&gt;<i> that I am aware of. It wasnt until a few restarts later that I had  
</I>&gt;<i> the crash that has me in the current situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everything on this pool is mirrored on another raid, so I can easily  
</I>&gt;<i> just destroy and recreate it. But I want to make sure there is no  
</I>&gt;<i> other useful info I can give you before I do.
