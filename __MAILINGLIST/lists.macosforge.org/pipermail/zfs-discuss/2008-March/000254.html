<PRE>It remains to be seen how often this takes place within actual user
systems, but in the broad scheme of things data corruption DOES occur:
<A HREF="http://storagemojo.com/2007/09/19/cerns-data-corruption-research/">http://storagemojo.com/2007/09/19/cerns-data-corruption-research/</A>

While, yeah, it matters for home directory stuff, it would also be
nice to move system stuff over onto a filesystem that actually will
keep track of whether files have become corrupted.  This would help
immensely in tracking down problems that are due to data corruption on
the disk end of things rather than corruption caused by software, or
just other system bugs.  I would also assume that if ZFS requests a
block of data from disk and doesn't get the checksum it requested that
it would re-request this data.  So that if either the drive's CRC
checks didn't catch something or if somehow data was not transmitted
correctly over the interconnects, you might have a chance of getting
things right the second time, even if you don't have redundancy
(correct me if I'm wrong here).

The other thing is that it would be quite nice to just have everything
run through lzjb or zlib or lzo (if that gets added down the road), or
to have selected portions run through that so things like
documentation can get compressed down and take up less disk space.
&gt;<i>From what I understand for lzjb and lzo, you can actually get
</I>increased disk performance since those algorithms are relatively
light-weight and you needn't write as much data to disk.  I've got my
home dir compressed with the default compression style and performance
seems pretty good.

I'm not asking about doing ZFS booting at this point, since I know
that doesn't work.  My question is more related to what can, at this
point, be put on ZFS without breaking the boot process?
