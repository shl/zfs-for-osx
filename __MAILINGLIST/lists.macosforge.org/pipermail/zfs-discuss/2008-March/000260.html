<PRE>All of this is true, but you can make that argument about any sort of
replacement or upgrade piece of software so long as there isn't
something broken that seriously inhibits daily work.  HFS+ (and
various adjustments) have worked mostly fine since Mac OS 8.1.

Everyone is motivated for differing reasons, however.  If the &quot;us&quot;
(referring to casual users) you refer to are those on this list, I'm
guessing that if one has interest enough to follow what's going on
with a beta/development release filesystem, and perhaps even play with
it, that we're probably not casual users.

The casual Mac user may never even hear about ZFS (how many actually
even know what HFS+ is?), but the end result is that it will, or
could, provide benefit to a wide variety of users on /Users or /.
Snapshots could be taken before software upgrades (and done in a way
that's more robust than Windows restore points), so that for those
rare events where something does blow up, you have something to go
back to that is known to work.  Time Machine backups should be
somewhat smaller when using snapshots that keep track of block level
changes, making these backups faster, including over slower, wireless
links.  You could also have snapshots kept locally so that there's a
local &quot;Time Machine&quot; for today's files or this weeks' files even
though you happen to be away from the drive you're backing up to.
Filesystem compression can reduce the need for even more gigantic
disks on laptops, etc..

On a related note, for a point not brought up, I think one reason why
boot is important over just using /Users is this: deriving storage on
one disk from multiple fixed-sized partitions is probably something
that would be an annoyance for a &quot;casual user.&quot;  People can certainly
understand mount points and partitions and whatnot (in a sense, they
do for having external USB drives or added internal storage), but
imagine having to explain to an aunt Sally that she needs to resize
her root partition and shrink her /Users paritition so that she can
install some new piece of software.

But yeah, I do understand your point :-)  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Frankly I have yet to be convinced that ZFS should be used for your

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; storage, database storage or something similar.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only advantage of ZFS on the Boot/User filesystem would be the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I was just thinking today about rolling more of my system over to ZFS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; since, with some exceptions, it seems to be fairly stable in usage.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; might Assume that Applications, Developer, maybe usr could switch over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to ZFS, but I'm not exactly sure what portions of the filesystem are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; required to bring up OS X.  /Library, /System likely need to be on HFS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; at this point I would assume, but what are the limitations, what needs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to be on HFS to get things up to the login screen?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Another question is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is it preferred to file bugs by using the Trac system?  Should they go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; on zfs-discuss here?  If one has a panic should that just go in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; through the normal Apple reporting system?  I do not have a full ADC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; membership so I cannot put anything on rdar as far as I know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thanks!
