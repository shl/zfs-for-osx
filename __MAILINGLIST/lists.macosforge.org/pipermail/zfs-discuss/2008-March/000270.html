What does that have to do with not being convinced that / should be ZFS? 
What's wrong with a mirror/raid /?

Sounds like a plan to me :-) I'd love to do this on OSX :-)

As for the question that started this conversation..

I wouldn't put too much on a zpool for now. You have to keep in mind 
that everything required for the system to start &amp; for the zpool to 
import needs to be on the HFS+ partition/drive.

The zpool doesn't seem to import until rather late in the boot process 
so I wouldn't try to put too much of the system on your zpool because it 
will probably just cause more of a headache than it's worth. I just 
stick to keeping my home dir on ZFS.
