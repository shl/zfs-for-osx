<PRE>Hi,
If you want to effectively want to run your system of a ZFS-Volume/ 
root-pool you could try this:
1. Install a barebones-Mac OS on a HFS partition.
2. Configure your root pool
3. create a Disk-image of sufficient size to hold all relevant data
4. perform a union mount of the image via hdiutil late in the boot  
process (You could do so by polling when your pool is available and  
then performing the mount)

This way you achieve:
- None of the problems related to emptying the trash, copying files/ 
folders with non-ascii characters, using special attributes etc.
- All data changes are reflected in your zfs-pool
- Everything that is required to have zfs available is taken from zfs
-You can even mount the HFS+-System as read-only

Potential issues:
-When installing new software that requires changes to the boot  
process, you might have to perform multiple reboots to modify your  
base Filesystem.
-If you are using sparse images or sparsebundles freed space is not  
automatically recovered. (this could also be done during the boot  
process, before mounting the image.
-Extra care is required in the shutdown process, that the image is  
unmounted and the pool gets exported right before the machine is  
powered down. Otherwise you might hang on shutdown, as you sometimes  
do when you forget to export your pools. (Has someone already written  
a script that will export or forcibly export pools during shutdown?)

The main reason I don't want to use ZFS for that now, is that I want  
to have a usable system with just the internal HD of my mac-mini  
present. I do try to move most reasonably important data into my pool  
soon after it is created, but the system can temporarily work without  
that.

If anyone tries above method, I'd be interested to know how well it  
works.
