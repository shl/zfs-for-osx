Great! We can share info!


&gt;<i> I have an MBP with eSATA-Card (with SIL3132-Chip)
</I>
I have one too, it works great with the external enclosure (hardware  
port multiplier)

Yes. I use Seagates. I had ordered two Western Digital &quot;green&quot; (low  
power) drives, one worked after some nudging, the other never worked,  
on three different computers, five different enclosures, three  
operating systems. I don't know why. I send both back and got Seagate  
7200.11 1 TB drives. Too bad, as I think those low-power Western  
Digital drives would be a slam-dunk for me: low heat, power, single- 
user.


&gt;<i> Another question is , what is the difference between MST5X1PM and

</I>
Hmm, let's look at that link again:
<A HREF="http://www.addonics.com/products/raid_system/mst4.asp">http://www.addonics.com/products/raid_system/mst4.asp</A>

OK - the &quot;HPM&quot; can be set up to do the RAID on the *enclosure*, rather  
than the *host computer*. You have to use a Sil3132 or 3134 controller  
to set up the RAID; your eSATA Card should work (but I don't know  
about RAID utilities for Mac OS X Leopard, you might need Windows via  
Boot Camp to set it up).  Once the RAID is set up, however, the  
enclosure will look like a single (large) drive, that you could use  
with any computer.
For ZFS, that's not what you want.
You want ZFS to provision the raidz array for you. For that, the host  
computer needs to see four individual drives.
The MST5X1PM uses a Port Multiplier, too, but can't do RAID on the PM:  
the host controller has one eSATA cable to the enclosure but sees four  
drives. SATA controllers that don't implement the port-multiplier spec  
will be confused and won't work. Your eSATA-Card should work fine.


Last week I discovered this:
<A HREF="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822204074">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822204074</A>
Must... not... hit... purchase... button! (gasp)

For $1000, you get four 1 TB SATA drives, the same port multiplier, a  
better enclosure (backplane rather than cables, supports hot-swap I  
think), the eSATA cable, and the PCIe host controller.  That's  
stunning. That's going to be $400-$600 less than doing it yourself.
But I haven't tested it yet, so I don't know. If someone wants to buy  
me one, I'll be happy to test it! :-)
