<PRE>Hi -

I was just thinking today about rolling more of my system over to ZFS
since, with some exceptions, it seems to be fairly stable in usage.  I
might Assume that Applications, Developer, maybe usr could switch over
to ZFS, but I'm not exactly sure what portions of the filesystem are
required to bring up OS X.  /Library, /System likely need to be on HFS
at this point I would assume, but what are the limitations, what needs
to be on HFS to get things up to the login screen?

Another question is:
Is it preferred to file bugs by using the Trac system?  Should they go
on zfs-discuss here?  If one has a panic should that just go in
through the normal Apple reporting system?  I do not have a full ADC
membership so I cannot put anything on rdar as far as I know.

Thanks!
