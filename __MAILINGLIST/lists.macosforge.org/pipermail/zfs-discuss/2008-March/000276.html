<PRE>Zetaback has incorporated support for using FIFOs on Mac OS X systems.
 It's not just a wrapper though it's set up as something you would run
from a cron or launchd process on any type of server with perl
installed, you can set full and incremental backup intervals, and
specify patterns for which pools and filesystems to include.  It is
server-side driven for the scheduling, though, with an agent script
that runs on whatever machines you are backing up with ZFS
filesystems.  I'm thinking about adding a few features I'd like, but
haven't gotten around to it yet.

One thing of note that the author didn't have issues with, but I did,
was that the suggested way of running it is to enable root on your OS
X hosts and have your server do passwordless (or you could always do
passworded if you wanted to do things manually) logins.  For some
reason I couldn't get to to run appropriately as root and had to use
my user account on my OS X client machine to run the zetaback agent.
To make this work, since my home is on ZFS and it makes a fifo
wherever the home directory is I modified the zetaback_agent script to
make the fifo in /tmp.  If you make the fifo on the ZFS filesystem
you're backing up for some reason the fifo just accumulates the send
buffer and things don't work properly.

You can find zetaback here:
<A HREF="https://labs.omniti.com/trac/zetaback">https://labs.omniti.com/trac/zetaback</A>

For the fifo path change, look for this in zetaback_agent:
my $fifo = &quot;zetaback_${$}_${FULL}${BASE}.fifo&quot;;

change it to:
my $fifo = &quot;/tmp/zetaback_${$}_${FULL}${BASE}.fifo&quot;;

Ultimately though, I really hope that piping works in the near future
:<i>-) I'd like to drive backups from the client end so that firewalls
</I>and varying network locations wouldn't be as much of a problem save
for the link speed.

</I>&gt;<i> creating the fifo and running the send and recv commands to make this easy.

</I>&gt;<i>    zsr [-vi] OldPool/<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">Filesystem at snapshot</A> NewPool[/Filesystem])
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone already knows of something similar I'd love to hear about it.
</I>&gt;<i> Bonus points for making it work via an ssh pipe (ie. connecting the read
</I>&gt;<i> side of the fifo to an ssh process that sends the data to a fifo on a remote
</I>&gt;<i> machine and runs a zfs recv command on it to read from the fifo to make it
</I>&gt;<i> easy to copy snapshots to a remote host.
