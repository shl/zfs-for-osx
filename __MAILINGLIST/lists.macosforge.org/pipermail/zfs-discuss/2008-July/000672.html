<PRE>Hi,

I've been playing with ZFS on an external 2-drive JBOD USB enclosure,
connected to a MacMini, just because it was what I had lying around and I
wanted something to test with.

Eventually I would like to try to build a ZFS photo archive (1TB+ of photos)
because of the integrity/checksumming features of ZFS. I'm not convinced ZFS
on Mac OS X is quite there yet, or at least I don't feel confident myself in
using it for that purpose, but I am sure it will be soon. I'm currently
storing them in a RAID-1 + Backup setup which works OK, though I have
discovered occasional corruption of images, and this concerns me.

What I would like to ask is what kind of external enclosures or other
hardware people are using for ZFS setups? I currently need to buy an
external 4 or 5-drive enclosure which I will run in JBOD or RAID, but I
would like the model I buy to be suitable for ZFS use later. One aspect I am
wondering about is the use of port-multiplier connections under ZFS in OS X.
I'm looking at maybe buying this model, which comes in both 4 x eSATA, and 1
x Port-Multiplier eSATA, versions. What do you think?

They also do a firewire version:

I currently own a PPC Mac Mini, and a Quicksilver G4 w/eSATA, but aim to
change the G4 for a MacPro sometime this year.

Many thanks,

Ben
