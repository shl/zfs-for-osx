No problem, and I hope you had a good vacation!

Classic ;-)

During the last 24 hours I've tested build-119 under heavy load with a
simple pool both residing in files, and on a 1TB disk, and was unable to
reproduce the deadlock (or, in fact, any failure). So, your fix fixed things
for me -- and thank you very much for pushing it out!

On a side note, thanks to zoink, a data point: Doing things on a zfs with
ca. 750'000 files will consume about 1GB of kernel memory in the module
(e.g. ls -lR &gt;/dev/null). I'll try this with insane amounts of files next,
to see how well-behaved the kext is when memory gets scarce on a 4GB system.
Unmounting and exporting the pool will make things drop down to 3MB for ZFS,
and ca. 30MB for ARC. Nice ;-) Unloading the kernel module does not seem to
be possible.
