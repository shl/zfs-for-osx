<PRE>Hi--

Is there any way to recover a pool?

Here's the scoop, in probably too much detail:

I'm a sucker for new filesystems and new tech in general. For you old- 
timers, I installed Sequoia when it was first seeded, and had to  
reformat my drive several times as it grew to the final release. I  
flipped the &quot;journaled&quot; flag before I even knew what it meant. I  
installed the pre-Leopard ZFS seed and have been using it for, what, a  
year?

So, I started with two 500 GB drives in a single pool, not mirrored. I  
bought a 1 TB drive and added it to the pool. I bought another 1 TB  
drive, and finally had enough storage (~1.5 TB) to mirror my disks and  
be all set for the foreseeable future.

In order to migrate my data from a single pool of 500 GB + 500 GB + 1  
TB to a mirrored 500GB/500GB + 1TB/1TB pool, I was planning on doing  
this:

1) Copy everything to the New 1 TB drive (slopping what wouldn't fit  
onto another spare drive)
2) Upgrade to the latest ZFS for Mac release (117)
3) Destroy the existing pool
4) Create a pool with the two 500 GB drives
5) Copy everything from the New drive to the 500 GB x 2 pool
6) Create a mirrored pool with the two 1 TB drives
7) Copy everything from the 500 GB x 2 pool to the mirrored 1 TB pool
8) Destroy the 500 GB x 2 pool, and create it as a 500GB/500GB  
mirrored pair and add it to the 1TB/1TB pool

During step 7, while I was at work, the power failed at home,  
apparently long enough to drain my UPS.

When I rebooted my machine, both pools refused to mount: the 500+500  
pool and the 1TB/1TB mirrored pool. Just about all my data is lost.  
This was my media server containing my DVD rips, so everything is  
recoverable in that I can re-rip 1+TB, but I'd rather not.

&quot;diskutil list&quot; says this:
/dev/disk1
    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE        
IDENTIFIER
    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *465.8 Gi    
disk1
    1:                                                    465.8 Gi    
disk1s1
/dev/disk2
    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE        
IDENTIFIER
    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *465.8 Gi    
disk2
    1:                                                    465.8 Gi    
disk2s1
/dev/disk3
    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE        
IDENTIFIER
    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *931.5 Gi    
disk3
    1:                                                    931.5 Gi    
disk3s1
/dev/disk4
    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE        
IDENTIFIER
    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *931.5 Gi    
disk4
    1:                                                    931.5 Gi    
disk4s1

During step 2, I created the pools using &quot;zpool create media mirror / 
dev/disk3 /dev/disk4&quot; then &quot;zpool upgrade&quot;, since I got warnings that  
the filesystem version was out of date. Note that I created zpools  
referring to the entire disk, not just a slice.

Googling for &quot;FDisk_partition_scheme&quot; yields &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/zfs-discuss/2008-March/000240.html">http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/zfs-discuss/2008-March/000240.html</A> 
 &gt;, among other things, but no hint of where to go from here.

&quot;zpool import -D&quot; reports &quot;no pools available to import&quot;.

All of this is on a Mac Mini running Mac OS X 10.5.3, BTW.

So, is the data recoverable?

Thanks!
Lee
