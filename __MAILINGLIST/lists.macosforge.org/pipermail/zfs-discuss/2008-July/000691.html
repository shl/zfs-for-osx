Sorry for the delay, this was me.  The moderator(a.k.a. me) was on  
vacation :)  I'm just now getting caught up on email.

As to the issue.  I believe this is actually a known bug that we just  
fixed.  Due to this bug:
6035783 ZFS hang during rename/open

I'll spare you the gory details, but basically when the machine was  
under heavy load, a.k.a. a lot of creates, we'd get into a hung  
situation since we were waiting for a recycled vnode with an open zfs  
transaction, and waiting for that vnode from the VFS.  The rest of the  
system is blocked on that transaction commiting, and it's stuck  
waiting for a vnode it's not going to get because the system is  
deadlocked.

anyway, if you want gory details let me know :)  But can you give  
zfs-119 a try? (I just posted it yesterday on the zfs.macosforge site)  
We just fixed this issue and the fix is in those bits.  If you still  
get a hang, please let me know.

thanks!!
Noel

</I>&gt;<i> I recently installed zfs-117 on a brand new, fully patched MacPro.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My next operation was an rsync --archive -H --sparse from a remote

</I>&gt;<i> 900'000 files, however the machine stopped responding after copying  
</I>&gt;<i> in about 70GB. When I say 'stopped responding' I mean that all  
</I>&gt;<i> applications became unresponsive (spinning color ball). Mouse still  
</I>&gt;<i> active. Pressing the power button and waiting a minute or two would  
</I>&gt;<i> yield a suspended mac. After resume, all applications would still be  
</I>&gt;<i> dead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I power-cycled the mac, and restarted the rsync process. This time,  
</I>&gt;<i> it was able to go through a very few files, before dying again.  
</I>&gt;<i> Again, the entire machine was stuck.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No log messages, no kernel messages, no dump -- the machine just  
</I>&gt;<i> being unresponsive. This was reproducable several times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fine, I thought. Let's try a real disk instead of files. Took a 1TB  
</I>&gt;<i> disk (internal), nuked everything on it, and used diskutil to create  
</I>&gt;<i> a zpool on with the disk in it, and then a zfs file system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Same operation, same behaviour. After the third or fourth try, the  
</I>&gt;<i> system would not reboot anymore, instead getting stuck on a light- 
</I>&gt;<i> blue display. Frustrated, I booted from DVD, and nuked the ZFS  
</I>&gt;<i> experiment, giving up for now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any recommendations on how to proceed with this issue? Should I file  
</I>&gt;<i> a ticket in <A HREF="http://zfs.macosforge.org/trac/newticket">http://zfs.macosforge.org/trac/newticket</A> ? Is this a  
</I>&gt;<i> known issue (I think not?), or is there a way I can gather more  
</I>&gt;<i> information for debugging purposes? I understand this incarnation of  
</I>&gt;<i> ZFS is work in progress -- and if I can help by providing useful  
</I>&gt;<i> information I'll gladly do so.
