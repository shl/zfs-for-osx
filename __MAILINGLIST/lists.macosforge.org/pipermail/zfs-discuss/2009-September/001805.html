I agree.

I am running a heavy PVR (a TV to the uninitiated) that uses a raidz1  
zpool as its data store.

This is often receiving multiple (up to 4) video streams while playing  
another one.  I know of no alternative software raid5 solution that  
could deal with this load.  Low to medium cost hardware raid5  
solutions on SATA generally seems to be able to throw your data away  
even without a disk failure!

Once past the inadequate Mac usage notes, this system has worked  
without any fault.  It goes to sleep, it wakes up, it gets hammered,  
it gets killed by a power glitch, it gets rebooted, its fine every time.

No ZFS means no upgrade.  There is no adequate disk management for  
windows and no adequate video software on Solaris.

But Apple will release either ZFS,  or another solution that provides  
the same capability, in time.  Because they're not stupid.

I suspect it just requires
	1)	resolution of any political issues when/if anyone actually  
completes the purchase of Sun
	2)	a Mac GUI for ZFS that would allow the average user to safely  
operate ZFS without generating an unacceptable support load.
and ZFS will return
