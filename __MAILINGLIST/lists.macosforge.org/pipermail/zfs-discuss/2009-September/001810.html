That they do, and I use them!  But not on my desktop, and not for  
video :)

True.  but now we have new things to talk about!  I'm going to try  
getting SL to work with the zfs I torrented from the post yesterday.   
I'll report my results here for the group.  That's constructive, yes?

My mother-in-law says the same thing.  Everyone else calls her a  
pessimist.


&gt;<i>  I think what is unhelpful is the fact that even after release we

That would be nice, but this is Apple, and it's how things are done  
there.  We have choices.  I choose to do my work on a Mac running OS  
X.  Unfortunately, with terabytes of video, ZFS is my best choice.  In  
fact, it's my only choice if I don't want to constantly swap out drives.

I'm also lamenting the fact that SiI 3132 drivers aren't supported.   
I've seen reports of them working with the 32-bit kernel, and i plan  
to try it and see.  But going to a different OS isn't a choice I plan  
to make.



&gt;<i> What's so hard about apple just saying
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hey guys, the project is dead&quot;
</I>
Ask Steve Jobs.  Let me know what he says. <A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">sjobs at apple.com</A>
