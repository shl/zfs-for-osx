<PRE>i was under the impression that installing various versions of zfs
(119 or the from the SL beta before it was removed) would be no
different than using zfs under leopard.

i'm not sure what you mean by 'the code to notice the presence of a
ZFS filesystem on an attached device.' OS X definitely notices the
presence of ZFS, it is marked ZFS in disk utility and i get a warning
that the partition is no longer supported before i mount it.

my use of zfs at this point involves read access to a video library
that's on a raidz pool, i've been watching all my shows and movies
without error except for the automounting which i haven't found
mentioned anywhere else.

thanks for the tip owen, i'm going to give it a try.

daniel, i tried zpool list from the terminal and it doesn't find any
pools. perhaps because i haven't been exporting the pool before
shutting down?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ever since i installed 10.6 and installed zfs-119 on top to access my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> zfs pool i've had to mount it manually after each boot by running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'sudo zpool import -f [pool]'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're a brave person.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't understand why this is, the pool used to be mounted on boot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under leopard and i was using the same version of zfs from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> macosforge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess you haven't followed this mailing list lately, or you would
</I>&gt;<i> have known that ZFS support was dropped from 10.6. I am pretty sure
</I>&gt;<i> that the code to notice the presence of a ZFS filesystem on an
</I>&gt;<i> attached device was not part of the zfs-119 bits. With that part gone
</I>&gt;<i> from 10.6, I think the most likely answer to your question ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is there a way to make this automatic again like it used to be?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... is no, at least not easily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I find it interesting to learn that zfs-119 still works on 10.6.
