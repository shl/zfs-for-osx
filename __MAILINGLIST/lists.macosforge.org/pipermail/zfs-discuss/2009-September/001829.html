<PRE>I've been doing a lot of digging around inside of Snow Leopard, and  
while ZFS is very much gone, it looks very much like it was a last  
minute removal.

I know, a lot of you are thinking &quot;duh!&quot;, except this is not based on  
the documentation that Apple continues to publish.

There are major references to ZFS all over the place, including in  
Disk Utility.

It appears that if the ZFSManager.framework existed within Snow  
Leopard, Disk Utility would gain the ability to manage a ZFS Volume.

/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ZFSManager.framework

Of interest is that Time Machine does not make any reference to ZFS,  
but it does make reference to HFS.

This is all speculation though, based mostly on a read through some of  
the de-compiled Disk Utility code. Not really like reading through pre- 
compiled code is the easiest of reads, but that is what I believe to  
have found thus far.

Unfortunately, this Private Framework never made it's way into a  
release from what I am told, not even within the 10a286 build that  
some of you have mentioned as having the dylibs, kext, fs and  
executable files to have ZFS v11 make a return to the GM release. I  
have not personally investigated this myself as I let my ADC  
subscription lapse quite some time ago.

So, I guess what interests us most is a bit of clarification,  
hopefully from someone at Apple.
Namely, will an updated build of ZFS be made available here on  
MacOSForge, the Developer Connection or any other location that  
someone could go if they felt inclined to get a working Snow Leopard  
install with ZFS support?

If so, will this ZFS implementation make use of these existing hooks  
within Snow Leopard or will we be using the command-line only  
utilities and the non-kernel linked modules?
