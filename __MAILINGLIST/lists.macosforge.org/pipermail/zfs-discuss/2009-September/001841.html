<PRE>&gt;<i> we (peons) don't have any word on that .. keep in mind
</I>&gt;<i> though, that   btrfs is on a completely different kernel
</I>&gt;<i> and as you point to - it has   a little ways to go to
</I>&gt;<i> match some of the feature/functionality that's   been
</I>&gt;<i> stable for a while now on ZFS
</I>
I'd add that not only we peons, but most of the people from
Sun itself don't know about Oracle plans - and the few that
know IMHO can't talk because of U.S. laws concerning
corporate acquisitions. Thus, I'd be surprised that Apple
knew something.

My opinion is that Oracle will drop BTRFS. BTRFS was to be
delivered by 2008 and a year later isn't production ready,
while ZFS is stable and used on Solaris since a few time - I
mean, ZFS has already got a reputation. Since Oracle agreed
to gpl BTRFS, I think they will just relicense ZFS to GPL
too and keep on with it (this means that ZFS will be usable
in Linux too). 

There are many products that seems duplicated in Oracle and
Sun stacks, and some have got reason to co-exist at least
for a few time, until they eventually merge. But I don't see
the reason for maintaining two different filesystems, given
that license issues are removed and that one is not
production ready.
