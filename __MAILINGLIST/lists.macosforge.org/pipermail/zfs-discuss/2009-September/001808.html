</I>Well, NFS and fileservers do work. :-)

I didn't say I gave up. When I give up I'll unsubscribe. I'm still on 
the list because I'm hoping there will be another release.
&gt;<i>

</I>No, but on gige nfs is pretty fast.

</I>Sure, but all of these issues have already been beaten to death on this 
list and with no updates in sight we're really just rehashing the same 
topics. Not that it's a problem, we can talk about how we can't empty 
the Trash for ever..

I don't really think it's my attitude that's not helpful, I think my 
attitude is realistic. Realism is always helpful. I think what is 
unhelpful is the fact that even after release we can't just get a 
straight answer about what is going on. What's so hard about apple just 
saying
&quot;hey guys, the project is dead&quot;
or
&quot;hey guys, the project isn't dead but there will be no releases for a 
long time&quot;
or
&quot;hey guys, the project isn't dead and there will be a release soon&quot;
or
&quot;hey guys, we don't even know what we're going to do yet&quot;

as opposed to the silence we have now? THAT isn't helpful and that 
actually affects you. My realism doesn't sway the project in any way so 
I don't think it's the problem here.
