<PRE>&gt;<i> My point is that is Apple pulling our legs. There could really be  
</I>&gt;<i> issues of this type, but nothing changed in the CDDL license since  
</I>&gt;<i> when ZFS was open sourced
</I>
I think the licensing issue is a red herring.  I'm sure the CDDL is  
more appealing for Apple anyway, and with Oracle buying up Sun you've  
got to think that that creates less problems.  Ellison is an former  
Apple board member and Jobs took the photographs at Ellison's wedding,  
so you would assume that that would make any licensing/legal problems  
easier to solve (worst case; &quot;I'll get my boss to ring your boss&quot;).   
The NetApp lawsuit again seems an unlikely cause as Sun have already  
invalidated most of NetApps claims, so again you would think as that  
case progresses (generally positively for Sun) that becomes even less  
of a problem.

I'm guessing it's a support issue.  There wasn't a good GUI for  
getting ZFS setup, and there are a lot of third party apps out there  
that could have problems with a new filesystem, even on the server  
side.  Furthermore, if you include it as a big feature then people  
will expect a GUI.  Even if you don't have a GUI and include it as  
command line tools, you'll have people using it possibly inadvisably  
and not quite aware of how different ZFS is to managing HFS+ volumes.

Apple wanted Snow Leopard out, but didn't want the headache of an  
officially included ZFS, because then they have to support it.  If  
someone has to go and download and install ZFS separately, it gets  
Apple off the hook as far as problems go.  Saying &quot;I downloaded this  
new filesystem, installed it, and lost all my data&quot; is much easier to  
deal with from Apple's point of view than &quot;I used this new filesystem  
you included in SL, and now my data is gone&quot;.

I'm expecting a new build to pop up on MacOSforge at some point, and  
the delay doesn't surprise me too much.

I tend to be over-optimistic at times though :-)
