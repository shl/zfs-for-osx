we (peons) don't have any word on that .. keep in mind though, that  
btrfs is on a completely different kernel and as you point to - it has  
a little ways to go to match some of the feature/functionality that's  
been stable for a while now on ZFS

filesystems are really complementary if you have devices to put them  
on - so IMHO it's in Oracle's best interest to keep development going  
on both - especially now becoming the default root filesystem for  
Solaris/OpenSolaris
