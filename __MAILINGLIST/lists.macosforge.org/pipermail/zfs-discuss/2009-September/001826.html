<PRE>For the record, MacRumors blogged about the issue:

<A HREF="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/09/01/lack-of-zfs-file-system-support-in-snow-leopard-due-to-licensing-issues/">http://www.macrumors.com/2009/09/01/lack-of-zfs-file-system-support-in-snow-leopard-due-to-licensing-issues/</A>


&quot;But then a couple of sources came in with a new angle: that Sun's 
licensing demands killed the deal. Sun prefers the CDDL [Common 
Development and Distribution License] and may have asked for some extra 
protections, including patent indemnification, that caused Apple to 
reconsider the business risk of ZFS.&quot;


My point is that is Apple pulling our legs. There could really be issues 
of this type, but nothing changed in the CDDL license since when ZFS was 
open sourced; and note that there's no reference in Oracle possibly 
changing this in a more restrictive way. I can't believe that the legal 
office of Apple discovered some issues only now. It rather seem an 
indirect way to put pressure on Sun / Oracle to release the thing under 
GPL. BTW, I don't question that - I'd be happy if ZFS was GPLled, as it 
would go into Linux kernel (*) - only that I don't like byzantine talk. 
Also, to be pointed out that these are only rumors, even though coming 
from a reasonably reputable source, and no official statements.

(*) But ZFS in Linux could bring more points to switching even more work 
from Mac OS X to Linux, in my perspective.
