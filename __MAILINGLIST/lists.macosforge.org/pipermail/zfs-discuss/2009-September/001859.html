<PRE>Negative... well, at least I'm pretty sure I haven't...

I tried to recompile the zfs-119 src to try and get 64-bit, but I was  
unable... or at least I'm sure I was unable to mount my pools. See now  
that I'm thinking about it, it might have been that because my pools  
are in the new ZFS format as I created them with the 10A286 binaries  
which support newer zfs revs (rev 11 I think?) however I didn't keep  
track of when I was in 64-bit or 32-bit mode. There was a LOT of  
restarting, holding down keys and nvram changes so it is a bit of a  
blur, but I don't think I was able to get either zfs-119 (binaries &amp;  
source) or 10A286 binaries loaded anytime while I was in 64-bit mode.

For certain I've had no joy with the 10A286 binaries in 64-bit mode.

In all of my messing around I didn't lose any data so you should be  
safe (as safe as you ever can be running these ZFS bits) to play around.

Make sure you completely remove any and all ZFS files before you copy  
new version (either old or new) as any lingering ZFS files gave me  
lots of trouble and repeated kernel panics even when browsing HFS+  
volumes.
