<PRE>+ charlienail &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">charlienail at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> i was under the impression that installing various versions of zfs
</I>&gt;<i> (119 or the from the SL beta before it was removed) would be no
</I>&gt;<i> different than using zfs under leopard.
</I>
The installation bit should be the same. The question was whether it
would work at all. Back when we were told that future versions of ZFS
would not work on Leopard, we were told that this was because because
of changes in the kernel. It was guessed (at least I guessed) that
this meant the 119 bits would not work on Snow Leopard, though that
doesn't follow logically - it's just a not totally unreasonable guess.

&gt;<i> i'm not sure what you mean by 'the code to notice the presence of a
</I>&gt;<i> ZFS filesystem on an attached device.'
</I>
I really meant the automounting part. I don't know what triggers it,
but am guessing configd.

&gt;<i> OS X definitely notices the presence of ZFS, it is marked ZFS in
</I>&gt;<i> disk utility
</I>
Yeah, it would be stupid of them to rip out every bit of recognition
of ZFS. There is no reason why disk utility shouldn't recognize all
sorts of stuff, whether it's supported or not. It gives users useful
information, after all.
