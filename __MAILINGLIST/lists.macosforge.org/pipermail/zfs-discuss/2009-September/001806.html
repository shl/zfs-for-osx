Not everyone, no.  I'm actually using zfs on OS X and happy with it.   
My problem now is that the SiI drivers for my eSATA ExpressCard aren't  
supported in Snow Leopard.  I have seen some reports that they will  
work with the 32-bit kernel and I plan to try it this weekend.  I  
figure my best chance is a clean install of SL, clean install of SiI  
driver, and the 10a286 ZFS driver.  If it all goes horribly wrong, I  
restore from Time Machine and no harm done except time spent learning  
it doesn't work.

Why are you still on this mailing list if you gave up a year ago.  I  
want to learn what works, what problems people are having, etc.  Not  
hear &quot;NFS!&quot;  and &quot;fileserver&quot;.

Have you ever tried editing video over NFS?

I'm not trying to be antagonistic, but your attitude is not helpful.   
This is the ZFS on OSX mailing list.
