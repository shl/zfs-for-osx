Right, there's 4 copies of the metadata. Two near the start of the  
disk, (1a, 1b) and two near the end (2a, 2b). What happens is ZFS  
writes to 1a first, then 2a, then 1b then 2b. The idea is that if the  
disk dies during the metadata write (which is the bit where the tree  
on disk goes from being Vn to Vn+1) then there should be a majority  
rule going on with the pointers to the tip of the tree. Indeed,  
there's recovery semantics which says which order to look at to find  
this out.

Unfortunately, USB disks are known for being slightly better than hand- 
writing on toilet paper for data integrity, and probably optimised the  
(1a,1b) write into the same call when flushing to disk. In fact, some  
USB devices have their own buffer and return 'yes' to the fsync call  
before they've actually sunc, which is why you can get this kind of  
problem. The very first USB enclosure I tried out with ZFS pointed out  
how bad the USB device was, and I went back to firewire and never  
looked back.

 From here, you might be able to find the on-disk locations for 1a,1b, 
2a and 2b and find out where they point to (as tip to the ZFS tree).  
The data is (likely) all on disk still, it's just the pointer that's  
pointing somewhere else. You might need to try up to 4 values  
(assuming that 1a..2b are all different) with an attempt at mounting  
each one in order to find out which pointer it is. At the very least,  
you should be able to find a root of a tree even if it was the n-1  
tree that was written to disk (and assuming that nothing's done disk  
writes since then).

The other thing to note is that ZFS on Mac is a little old - you might  
get joy with booting up a newer copy of OpenSolaris in VitualBox or  
equivalent and seeing if the recovery strategies are more advanced  
there.
