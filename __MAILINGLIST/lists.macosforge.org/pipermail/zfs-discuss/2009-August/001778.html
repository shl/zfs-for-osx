<PRE>I ripped the ZFS bits out of 10a286 and have installed them on newer 
builds of 10.6, which gives you zfs v11

Honestly though, who cares? Who wants to use some crappy unsupported 
piece of shit? It's over. There's nothing to see here, cows turn 
themselves inside out all the time.

I was hoping that maybe after release we would hear something and they 
were just doing the usual Apple &quot;retarded counterproductive secrecy for 
no reason&quot; thing they always do but that didn't happen. So I'm going to 
format these drives HFS+ and not worry about it. You all should too.

Though I have to say I will be extremely disappointed if I destroy my 
zpool and then sometime next week find out there's new bits..but I've 
been holding my breath long enough.
