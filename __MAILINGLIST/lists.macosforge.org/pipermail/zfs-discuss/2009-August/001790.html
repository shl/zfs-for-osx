</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, to me, my data is more important than my OS. If Snow Leopard

</I>&gt;<i> in upgrading anyway (especially for servers) and whilst it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> nice to have for my laptop (which yes, runs ZFS) I'll take 
</I>&gt;<i> snapshotting over snazzy graphics anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Snow leopard is mainly a line in the sand for future backward 
</I>&gt;<i> compatible releases (&quot;needs 10.6 or greater&quot;) and is a good way of 
</I>&gt;<i> saying &quot;only intel processors are supported&quot; without actually invoking 
</I>&gt;<i> it by name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I expect the situation to resolve itself for 10.7, either by 
</I>&gt;<i> adding ZFS to OSX or continuing to run 10.5 for another few years.
</I>I could live well without SL for a long time too - for testing, I can 
install it on other computers than my laptop. Also, sooner or later I'll 
be able to install OpenSolaris in one of the partitions; still, among 
other things, I need to access 320GB of data from MAc OS X for image 
management, and I don't trust HFS+ since when I discovered that it 
corrupted some files without any underlying hardware trouble.

Still, since Apple won't tell us anything about their plans, I don't 
feel good in just waiting for a year with the risk that they aren't 
doing anything. Also, there are some bugs with the current 
implementation that I'd like to see fixed in the meantime. Sorry, I 
can't trust Apple any longer.
