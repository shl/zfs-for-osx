<PRE>  I know that's right, there is a chance for such a product, but  
because there is a steep learning curve
to install, configure and manage the existing kernel extensions I  
guess there're only a few number of people
who use it. Beside that, most people will have no advantage of using  
it, because of the lack of support of
TimeMachine for Snapshots, Diskutil for management functions or the  
Admin Tools for sharing.
So at the moment I only see the server market as the primary target at  
the moment, but that's even more difficult.
