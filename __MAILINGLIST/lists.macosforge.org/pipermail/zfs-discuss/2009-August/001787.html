<PRE>&gt;<i> No money no party, but money can come in many ways; for instance people

I think the thing you're missing is this:  Money isn't necessarily the
problem - there's plenty of projects that succeed just fine without
money and/or professional development.

But consider this:  The people who really _care_ about ZFS on OSX are
on this mailing list.  Only we few.  It's beyond my skill level, and
for the few who are skilled enough, it's hard enough that they don't
want to battle the learning curve.

Just because it's open source doesn't mean that anybody can work on
it; the source code being open doesn't change the fact that it's a
difficult project to work on -- well beyond the skill level of most
coders (ie. mere mortals).

Porting ZFS is a difficult thing, as it is _very_ different from the
filesystems that preceded it.  Because it's so different, aspects in
the OS that are made to make filesystem work easier simply don't
apply.  (VFS layer, for example - ZFS has been accused of &quot;rampant VFS
layer violations&quot;.  You have to hook into the kernel someplace else,
as the pre-existing VFS layer is worthless for ZFS.  Even if it
weren't for the license issue, the Linux devs had issues with ZFS
because of &quot;rampant&quot; VFS layer violations/bypassing.  (It's still an
issue with btrfs, with quite a bit of dissension because it also
bypasses some of the VFS)
