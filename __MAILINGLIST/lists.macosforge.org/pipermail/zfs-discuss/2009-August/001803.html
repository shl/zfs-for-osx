<PRE>Had pretty much quit using my zfs drives at all. Frequent kernel panics
frustrated me to the point of being done with zfs on OS X. Last week my
system drive failed and I had to reinstall Leopard. After a complete
install will all Leopard updates was complete, I installed the 119 bits
on my fresh system. Five days later still no kernel panics. What's up?
The only reason I installed 119 on my fresh system was move data to an
HFS drive and give up on zfs.

*****Now I'm thinking I should keep zfs but I'm concerned that the
instability will resurface. Has anyone else seen this issue?

1.6 GHz PowerMac G5
2 GB memory
3 1 TB HD in Raidz1
119 bits
10.5 w/all updates
