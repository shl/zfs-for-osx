<PRE>Hi there.

After more than year of fine operations, I'm experiencing
troubles. Two months ago I had a kernel panic during a ZFS
operation - the kernel panic reappeared a few seconds after
rebooting and logging in. I was finally able to solve the
issue by accessing the partition with Linux and ZFS-Fuse,
identifying the troubled filesystem and removing it. I had
forgotten to file an issue about that, but I've done now
with the kernel panic info:

<A HREF="http://zfs.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/21">http://zfs.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/21</A>

Then I forgot about it because everything was fine.

This morning I had again a kernel panic - a filesystem was
just filled up and I had just run the trick echo &gt;
existing_file to free some space and then remove files.
Again, I get a kernel panic after each reboot and login.
Unfortunately, this time even Linux hangs up when I run zfs
commands and I don't know how to fix the problem. I'm not
even able to get a core dump, so I don't know whether it's
the same error as two months ago.

What would help me a lot would be how to disable the
automatic mount of ZFS filesystems by Mac OS X: I could
manually mount all the filesystems but the troubled one, and
at least continue working normally (the problem is probably
with a filesystems with my photos).

Thanks.
