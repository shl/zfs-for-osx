Because Mac 10.5's kernel had a way at looking at volumes mounted by  
their device ID. Sadly, this doesn't apply to ZFS ZPools instead, so  
the approach was always a bit of a bodge. In addition, Finder (Carbon- 
based in 10.5) had certain assumptions about the disks devices and  
being able to directly access then, which is why Finder can't empty  
trashes on a ZFS disk.

In order to fix both of these, the Mac OS X kernel had to be changed  
to provide different hook points. Similarly, the Finder was re-written  
in Cocoa to take advantage of various new features over and above ZFS.

Apple's policy is to not make any materials of the next version  
available until it's released - which includes (public) work on open  
source projects with new dependencies. I recall an earlier post  
apologising for the lack of folding this back into the 10.5 stream due  
to the large changesets involved in ZFS.

&gt;<i> So, what's the story there?  If it's always been as simple as &quot;let's  
</I>&gt;<i> just work on it&quot;, I'd think we should have a decent implementation  
</I>&gt;<i> by now.

It hasn't. The rumour is that it's a legal thing with the Sun/Oracle  
takeover. Whilst Sun has always played nice with Apple, there's no  
guarantee that Oracle is going to do the same. It may also be to the  
remaining suit between Sun and NetApp, but that's pretty unlikely.

If it's not legal, but merely system stability before the release date  
(and who hasn't seen the occasional kernel panic with ZFS), then we  
might expect builds and public binaries to continue now that 10.6 is  
out.

However, the complete removal of the ZFS readonly kernel (which, by  
itself, wouldn't have caused kernel panics on its own) suggests that  
it's unlikely to come back soon.
