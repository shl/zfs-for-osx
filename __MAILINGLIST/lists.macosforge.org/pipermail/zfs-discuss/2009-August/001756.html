A take-down notice against a mailing list is an interesting concept.  In
any case the NDA will say when it expires.

ZFS is not licensed under GPL but rather a Sun license (CDDL?) which is
why linux doesn't have ZFS.  I haven't read that license but presumably
it grants rights to use patents within the terms of the license.  Oracle
can't revoke a license retroactively except as provided by the original
license at the time it was granted.

The issue may be as simple as one of maintenance.  Right now Apple has
one filesystem they maintain - HFS - and everything else is essentially
imported with varying degrees of customization.  With the Sun/Oracle
transition there is a likelihood that Apple would have to become the
primary maintainer for their branch of ZFS, and that's a (cost) burden
they may not be willing to take on unless they get serious with their
server product.

As to what Oracle will do - who knows?  BTRFS is being developed
essentially with Oracle sponsorship under GPL so it's not guaranteed ZFS
will be locked up.  It's not out of the question for Oracle to GPL ZFS
so they can use it in their own linux based products, though corporate
politics being what they are Oracle may stick with BTRFS in spite of the
difference in maturity.

I don't expect any official answers any time soon.  The best we can hope
for is to have the existing ZFS/OSX code to get whatever updates may be
needed to work on Snow Leopard.  Until then I'm staying with Leopard.
