Why has there not been any development work on the open source  
codebase since Build 119?

I'm a huge fan of open source (I'm a founding member of an open source  
user group), but I'm really disappointed at how this project started  
on macosxforge (I'm assuming by Apple engineers), released a little  
bit of code, then went into hibernation as the code (and one would  
assume the developers, based on the lack of public activity) was  
sucked into Apple proprietary closed source land.

So, what's the story there?  If it's always been as simple as &quot;let's  
just work on it&quot;, I'd think we should have a decent implementation by  
now.
