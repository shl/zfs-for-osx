<PRE>+ Alex Blewitt &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">alex.blewitt at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> So, what's going on with ZFS? Why was it unceremoniously yanked from
</I>&gt;<i> Mac OS X, even the read only bit?
</I>
Only the Apple employees on the list will know that, and they can't
talk about it until the Apple lawyers say they can talk. If it's the
lawyers who gagged them in the first place, which doesn't seem
unlikely.

&gt;<i> Since you're unlikely to be able to comment if it's legal related, but
</I>&gt;<i> you will if it's technical, silence on the matter will indicate that
</I>&gt;<i> ZFS on Mac is doomed ...
</I>
No, silence will only indicate that it's likely legal related.
Assuming that legal proceedings are still going on, we can't know the
answer until it is over. It's frustrating, I know. I am sticking with
Leopard for now, even though I've paid for a software maintenance
contract that gives me SL at no extra cost.
