<PRE>I forgot about the pending legal issues with NetApp.  Honestly, I hope that
is the reason ZFS has been, according to earlier posters, pulled entirely
from the client and server builds of OS X (including the read-only kext).
 We know from earlier posts on this list by Apple employees that it was
running on 10.6 and that it required backwards-incompatible changes to match
changes in the 10.6 kernel (which means that the last released build, 119,
probably won't run on 10.6, although I don't know anyone who has actually
tried it), so it doesn't seem likely it is a technical issue.


If it was pulled from 10.6 due to the legal questions, then I think it is
likely the new bits will come out on MacOS forge.  If Sun were to lose its
case or settle it in an unfavorable way, it could be very costly for Apple
to have to remove ZFS support from a shipping product and potentially pay a
licensing fee for every copy they've already sold.  However, simply having
to pull it down from the macosforge.com website would be far simpler and
(IANAL) I don't think they would have any legal responsibilities beyond
that.


The more I think about it, the more this makes sense.  Why else would Apple
remove even read-only support, which has been in 10.5 since the initial
release?  The only other reason I can think of is that in the switch to the
10.6 kernel ZFS had taken a huge step backwards in stability, but that
wasn't the impression various Apple employees (and earlier builds with it
in, purportedly) had given us.


Furthermore, the good news on the lawsuit is that, while it is a long
process, it looks like Sun will prevail.  The most recent summary I could
find on the suit is from back in October of 2008: NetApp faces Sun lawsuit
loss &#8226; The Register&lt;<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/07/sun_gets_netapp_patent_invalidated/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/07/sun_gets_netapp_patent_invalidated/</A>&gt;.
 According to Sun's page on the lawsuit, NetApp Patent Lawsuit Against ZFS
Open Source Technology &lt;<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/lawsuit/zfs/">http://www.sun.com/lawsuit/zfs/</A>&gt;, as of 7/09 the
last NetApp patent relating to the core ZFS technology, the &quot;292&quot; patent,
has been rejected by the USPTO.  So it looks like this could be resolved
later this year and that Sun will have an unqualified victory.  Which means
ZFS would likely be added back into 10.6 in a point release.


Of course, the other looming issue is Sun's pending sale to Oracle and their
propensity for using the GPL as their preferred open source license (due to
their support of Linux).  While they can't undo the current licensing, the
GPL isn't compatible with OS X and Apple may decide to abandon it if they
can't benefit from the heavy-lifting done in the future by others.  AFAIK,
Apple hasn't contributed anything upstream, save perhaps some bug fixes or
reports, but rather just ported the work of others to OS X.

However, it's debatable ZFS would be of much value to Linux, as they've
already got a lot of momentum behind their ZFS clone, btrfs (also
developed/supported by Oracle), and Linux has a very strong Not Invented
Here culture.  But I can see how from Apple's perspective it would be
prudent to hold off on ZFS until the dust settles on the Oracle acquisition
of Sun.


So, there's a discussion of the non-technical reasons potentially behind
ZFS' disappearance from 10.6.  It would be nice if we could get some input
from Apple engineers.  I wonder if their silence has been because of 10.6 or
because someone higher up at Apple finally read what they were writing.  I
was always surprised at how open (for Apple) they were.  Almost like they
intended to interact with the community.
