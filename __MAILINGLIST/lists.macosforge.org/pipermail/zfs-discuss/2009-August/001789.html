Lets give Noel et al the chance to. Respond - people in all  
departments just prior to a release are very busy and will often have  
a holiday just afterwards. I wouldn't write it off because there's no  
response within 24h. If there's none within a week or two, that's more  
of a problem.

Re &quot;isn't anyone going to take it over&quot; the source is wildly out of  
date with Sun's release, and as I've said, the kerrnel was tweaked a  
bit (and possibly that's where the bugs still are). The kernel  
extension is where you have the source, but not the kernel.

Lastly, to me, my data is more important than my OS. If Snow Leopard  
doesn't support ZFS, I won't be upgrading. There's very little benefit  
in upgrading anyway (especially for servers) and whilst it would be  
nice to have for my laptop (which yes, runs ZFS) I'll take  
snapshotting over snazzy graphics anyway.

Snow leopard is mainly a line in the sand for future backward  
compatible releases (&quot;needs 10.6 or greater&quot;) and is a good way of  
saying &quot;only intel processors are supported&quot; without actually invoking  
it by name.

Anyway, I expect the situation to resolve itself for 10.7, either by  
adding ZFS to OSX or continuing to run 10.5 for another few years.
