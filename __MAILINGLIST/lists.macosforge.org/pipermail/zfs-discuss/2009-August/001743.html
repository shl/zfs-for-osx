How much time does it take to remove ZFS? It's all isolated in a
kernel extension, a file system extension, a library and some
executables. Removing those bits can't be all that costly. There may
be some kernel tweaks that were necessary to make it work, and I bet
they haven't removed those. OTOH, it's conceivable that other changes
in the kernel have rendered the current extensions inoperative, and
that Apple didn't presently want to spend the time restoring kernel
compatibility with the ZFS bits.

I agree that assuming ZFS will be back in 10.7 is perhaps being too
optimistic; but I also think assuming it won't is too pessimistic.
At this point, there just isn't enough information available to even
make an educated guess.

(Personally, I won't upgrade to Snow Leopard if I can't have ZFS.)
