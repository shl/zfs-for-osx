The roadside is littered with dozens of tetris clones, for example.
But I can't think of a significant project which does not have $$ or
professionals developing it.

&gt;<i> But consider this:  The people who really _care_ about ZFS on OSX are
</I>&gt;<i> on this mailing list.  Only we few.  It's beyond my skill level, and
</I>&gt;<i> for the few who are skilled enough, it's hard enough that they don't

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just because it's open source doesn't mean that anybody can work on
</I>&gt;<i> it; the source code being open doesn't change the fact that it's a
</I>&gt;<i> difficult project to work on -- well beyond the skill level of most
</I>&gt;<i> coders (ie. mere mortals).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Porting ZFS is a difficult thing, as it is _very_ different from the
</I>&gt;<i> filesystems that preceded it.  Because it's so different, aspects in
</I>&gt;<i> the OS that are made to make filesystem work easier simply don't
</I>&gt;<i> apply.
</I>
One of the reasons it is not called the &quot;Zettabyte File System&quot; is
because ZFS is much more than a file system.  Expecting it to
port as a file system is asking too little of it.

&gt;<i> (VFS layer, for example - ZFS has been accused of &quot;rampant VFS
</I>&gt;<i> layer violations&quot;.  You have to hook into the kernel someplace else,
</I>&gt;<i> as the pre-existing VFS layer is worthless for ZFS.  Even if it
</I>&gt;<i> weren't for the license issue, the Linux devs had issues with ZFS
</I>&gt;<i> because of &quot;rampant&quot; VFS layer violations/bypassing.  (It's still an
</I>&gt;<i> issue with btrfs, with quite a bit of dissension because it also
</I>&gt;<i> bypasses some of the VFS)
</I>
VFS was designed for people to port file systems to Linux more easily.
Unfortunately, what the market needs is a better way to manage
data, not just another file system. Until Linux changes to embrace
this, it will continue to have disjoint file system and data management
solutions.

I suppose it goes without saying that ZFS ports relatively easily to
the BSD variants :-)
