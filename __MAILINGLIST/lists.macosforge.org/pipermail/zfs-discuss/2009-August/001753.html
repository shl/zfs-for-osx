<PRE>So, Snow Leopard is out. The NDA is presumably lifted, or at least can  
be talked about without fear of a DMCA takedown (unless you're The  
Register*)

So, what's going on with ZFS? Why was it unceremoniously yanked from  
Mac OS X, even the read only bit?

I hope you're going to come back with some story about being not-quite- 
ready and that there'll be some fresh bits to download as otherwise I  
won't be upgrading.

My bigger fear is that it's a licensing issue due to the Oracle  
takeover which would blow it out of the water completely at least in  
the Snow Leopard timeframe. (Whilst I know the source code is GPL,  
it's possibly covered by patents that may be questionable under  
Oracle's rule.)

Since you're unlikely to be able to comment if it's legal related, but  
you will if it's technical, silence on the matter will indicate that  
ZFS on Mac is doomed ...

Alex
