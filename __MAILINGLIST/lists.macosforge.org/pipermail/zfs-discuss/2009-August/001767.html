Yes, I gave a detailed discussion of this in the last thread on this
subject, &quot;About ZFS on MacOs&quot;.

Moreover, Sun provides indemnity towards customers and communities that use
&gt;<i> its
</I>&gt;<i> products.  Apple is specifically listed as someone who gets this
</I>&gt;<i> indemnity for ZFS.  In other words, NetApp can spit &amp; sputter about
</I>&gt;<i> Apple using ZFS, but Sun has already signed up to take the blame - and
</I>&gt;<i> Oracle inherits it - which they would have to do anyway, as Oracle is
</I>&gt;<i> developing btrfs, which uses a lot of the same things that NetApp is
</I>&gt;<i> suing about..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/harvesting_from_a_troll">http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/harvesting_from_a_troll</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Second, Sun protects the communities using our technologies under
</I>&gt;<i> free software licenses. As an example, Apple is including ZFS is in
</I>&gt;<i> their upcoming &quot;Leopard&quot; OS X release. This is happening without any
</I>&gt;<i> payment to Sun (that's how truly free software works). Under the
</I>&gt;<i> license, we've waived all rights to sue them for any of the patents or
</I>&gt;<i> copyright associated with ZFS. We've let Apple know we will use our
</I>&gt;<i> patent portfolio to protect them and the Mac ZFS community from Net
</I>&gt;<i> App. With or without a commercial relationship to Sun.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I really don't see there being a credible threat to Apple - 'course
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not a lawyer, and Apple fields all kinds of frivolous lawsuits.
</I>

I'm afraid you've misread Jonathan's post.  He says that Sun indemnifies its
*customers*, not communities.  And Apple is not a customer of Sun's.  He
then says &quot;We've let Apple know we will use our patent portfolio to protect
them and the Mac ZFS community from Net App.&quot;  That is very, very different
from indemnity.  So, as I mentioned earlier, Apple is potentially in legal
jeopardy should NetApp win even part of its lawsuit.  I believe that there
is one key patent of NetApp's relating to ZFS that hasn't been invalidated
(yet; I believe it is being re-examined now).

I've yet to hear a better guess as to why Apple would completely strip ZFS
from 10.6.  Even with a radical shift in filesystem strategy, why remove
read-only support?  Especially when Apple knows they have customers using it
who will at least need to migrate their data off of ZFS?  I can't think of
anything else that would make sense.  Hopefully, now that 10.6 is out, we'll
hear something from an insider within a week.
