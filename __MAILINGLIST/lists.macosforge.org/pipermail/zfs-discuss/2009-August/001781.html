<PRE>Hi Fabrizio

When I first looked at ZFS on Mac, I did download the source of 119  
and rolled my own
binaries in Xcode. I was really disappointed when I realized that  
_nothing_ happened
with regards to source or even wiki pages updates.

I then downloaded the whole darwin source (I think it was at 10.5.6),  
looked
around the kernel infrastructure to learn how ZFS would fit into it.

After all of that I realized that it was way too hard to contribute,  
because I
would have to be able to understand changes neccessary in Darwin and  
ZFS.

I did try kernel driver development on my own for Linux, which was far  
easier, because
everything was in one place, i.e block device layer, generic fs layer,  
etc.

If you look a few messages back on the list, you'll note that Finder  
relies
on block-level access to the device to clear the Trash.

This kind of stuff made me stop looking, because the learning curve  
was way too steep for me.

I'm not at all a Linux kernel expert, I'm even less of a Darwin  
expert, but I did try
to have a look.

I never understood how I would contribute to darwin/zfs anyway. As far  
as I understood my changes
would never been picked up. It is open source, but as far as I know,  
nobody claimed that contributions
would be accepted. If I'm wrong, I apologize.

Don't get me wrong, it's just my opinion.
