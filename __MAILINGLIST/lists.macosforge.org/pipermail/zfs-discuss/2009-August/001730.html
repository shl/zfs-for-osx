<PRE>+ Rarok &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">rarokillo at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Hello. A few questions about ZFS on Mac.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if this subforum is a good place for asking.
</I>
It's the best place to ask.

&gt;<i> What about the stability of ZFS from macosforge?
</I>
Stability? Tremendous. There hasn't been an upgrade in ages. So if
that is the kind of stability you're looking for, fine. If you are
looking for stability in the sense of your computer not crashing or
having other problems, the answer is a bit more mixed. You might have
a look at the mailing list archives. In particular, one bit of advice:
Having zfs raided or mirrored is NOT a substitute for taking backups.

&gt;<i> There is any news about it on Snow Leopard?
</I>
Apparently, Snow Leopard won't support ZFS. We can only hope that the
current ZFS will work with SL, but there is no guarantee of that
even. All this is highly unofficial; as far as I remember, nobody from
Apple has posted a word on this list since it was discovered that SL
doesn't come with ZFS. For all we know, it is possible that Apple has
abandoned ZFS altogether. But I don't think it's likely; it's probably
just on the back burner. Maybe the ZFS team has been drafted into
getting SL out the door.
