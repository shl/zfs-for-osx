</I>I understand, but the principle of open source is that the community at 
least helps with testing. I still have to get back from my holidays and 
buy SL, so it will take a few days, but then I have a spare Mac where I 
could run some tests. What I don't have is the time to run long, 
attended tests, so it would be nice the availability of some automated 
stress test to run and forget (and check back some hours later).
