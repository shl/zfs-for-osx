<PRE>I agree that the 10A286 bits on 10A432 are not a good long-term
option; they're still useful for those who need to migrate their files
to a non-ZFS disk or to a non-ZFS-supporting server.

Back when it became clear that Apple was killing ZFS in 10.6, I set up
an OpenSolaris file server to receive the 3x 1.5TB RAID-Z that I had
been [mostly] happily using in 10.5.  It continues to perform
admirably, since a dual core &quot;storage processor&quot; with 4GB of RAM
dedicated to nothing else is good competition for a MacBook Pro with
3GB of RAM, even when crippled with SMB over GigE.  However, it really
irritates me that Spotlight doesn't search network volumes - at least
not SMB ones.  Does Spotlight search NFS mounts?  Are there any other
solutions to the Spotlight dilemma, apart from buying an Xserve, for
which I have neither the money nor the space / acoustic isolation?
