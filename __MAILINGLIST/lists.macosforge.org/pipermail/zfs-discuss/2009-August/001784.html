</I>No money no party, but money can come in many ways; for instance people 
exist that promote their competence by means of FLOSS, and make money on 
consultancy. Money don't necessarily come from the big ones; there are 
corporates that have been created out of open source and live on their 
own; furthermore, I don't know how many people are using ZFS on Mac OS 
X, but if they are a big number, there could be even market chances for 
a company that maintains ZFS for Mac OS X (GPL doesn't forbid making 
money out of FLOSS either, I think CDDL is the same). Yes, I would 
personally pay (a reasonable price) for it.

And why exclude that Sun/Oracle couldn't give some sponsorship (clearly 
not now, until the Oracle deal is finished)?

</I>&gt;<i> I except to see some developments with the next version of Xsan.
