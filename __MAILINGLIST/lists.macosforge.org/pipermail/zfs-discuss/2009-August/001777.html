Those all sound like reasons why *Apple* has not released code, and  
given that b119 was released way before much of these details you  
mention were public (or even Apple-internal knowledge), my question  
stands.

Are there not any independent, non-Apple developers working on this  
project?  Shouldn't this open source (ie. &quot;hopefully-not-vendor- 
locked&quot;) project be able to release code without Apple's direct  
involvement?
