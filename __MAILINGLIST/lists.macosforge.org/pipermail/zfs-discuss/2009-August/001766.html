<PRE>&gt;<i> I still think that this is a legal issue. &#160;That neatly explains the complete
</I>&gt;<i> scrub of ZFS bits from Snow Leopard and the complete silence from everyone
</I>&gt;<i> at Apple. &#160;Maybe they are hoping that if NetApp salvages some partial win
</I>&gt;<i> they will have forgotten that Apple shipped ZFS with 10.5? &#160;:)
</I>
A number of NetApp's patents have already been invalidated.  Moreover,
Sun provides indemnity towards customers and communities that use its
products.  Apple is specifically listed as someone who gets this
indemnity for ZFS.  In other words, NetApp can spit &amp; sputter about
Apple using ZFS, but Sun has already signed up to take the blame - and
Oracle inherits it - which they would have to do anyway, as Oracle is
developing btrfs, which uses a lot of the same things that NetApp is
suing about..

<A HREF="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/harvesting_from_a_troll">http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/harvesting_from_a_troll</A>

&quot;Second, Sun protects the communities using our technologies under
free software licenses. As an example, Apple is including ZFS is in
their upcoming &quot;Leopard&quot; OS X release. This is happening without any
payment to Sun (that's how truly free software works). Under the
license, we've waived all rights to sue them for any of the patents or
copyright associated with ZFS. We've let Apple know we will use our
patent portfolio to protect them and the Mac ZFS community from Net
App. With or without a commercial relationship to Sun.&quot;

So I really don't see there being a credible threat to Apple - 'course
I'm not a lawyer, and Apple fields all kinds of frivolous lawsuits.

Still, it's depressing that Apple removed ZFS.
