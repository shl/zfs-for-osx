<PRE>Hoping for some new bits, I had a round list reading, and came down  
this thread again. While it hasn't been said as clearly as it possibly  
could, I now realize that either there will be a 10.5.x... release  
incorporating the most important kernel changes made for SL+zfs, or  
we'll have to move away from ZFS for Mac OS X on anything pre-SL. That  
is to say, dump anything back to HFS+ until SL is out and stable.

The following comment might be a little OT, but I'll get rid of it  
here where I know that some very competent people are listening.

I get Your points about the kernel changes, and also that SL will be a  
&quot;preformance and stability&quot; release of the OS (following an overall  
trend in the industry...). So, while the hope for a backport of ZFS to  
10.5 is now rapidly leaving the house, anotherone takes its place:  
that marketing and sales will offer us an upgrade path to SL Server  
which honour the patience, perseverance and loyalty of many  
administrators and customers.

While SL will be a major upgrade certainly covering many thousands of  
man-hours, it still presents itself more and more like a highly needed  
cleanup &amp; bugfix round. I'm not going to open up a thread here about  
the problems I and many others have had with Leopard Server  
(particularly in environments with heavy use of DS and AFP), but I've  
had days where frustration reached levels never experienced before  
with OSX and Apple products in general. Long-missing new zfs bits and  
the statement that it will probably never be ported back to 10.5.x  
just round up my frustration (even if I know that the problems I  
encountered are unrelated to ZFS, which I fortunately never dared  
implementing in production environments)...

As always, regards and best wishes for the Snow Leopard release in  
general
and a cool, rock stable ZFS implementation on top of it...
