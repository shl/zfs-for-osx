<PRE>+ Robert Muench &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">robert.muench at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> 1. Datapool / Datasets: I have created one pool but no explicit
</I>&gt;<i> dataset. I read something about datasets but I'm not sure for what
</I>&gt;<i> these are. Is a dataset like a parition inside a ZFS pool?
</I>
Somewhat. They are filesystems. You create and manage them using the
zfs command. The top-level filesystem has the same name as the pool
and is automatically created when you create the pool. But they are
better than partitions, because you don't give them a predefined
size. Any of them can grow to occupy all free space, after which none
of them can grow until you delete something.

One reason for having several filesystems on the pool is that you can
take individual snapshots. There may be some data that you wish to
snapshot every day, and others that you'd rather not.

&gt;<i> 4. Is there anything I need to consider or take care about while
</I>&gt;<i> using the ZFS volume? Or can I just use it like every other drive?
</I>
You should be fine using it like any drive, except as you have found
out zfs is not so very well integrated with everything mac yet.

- Harald
