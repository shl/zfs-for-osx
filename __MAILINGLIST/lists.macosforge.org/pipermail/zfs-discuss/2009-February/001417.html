<PRE>+ Colin Johnson &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">colin_s_johnson at comcast.net</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Actually, mirrors are not a good solution for data protection - 
</I>&gt;<i> backups are!
</I>&gt;<i> RAIDs do not save you from losing data and a mirror will write crap 
</I>&gt;<i> to two disks just as easily as one ;)
</I>
Indeed. It's time for an anecdote: In Norway, all card transactions 
in stores (and ATM transacations) are handled by one company (BBS) 
acting on behalf of the banks. A few years ago they opened a new data 
center so they could remain in operation even if the first center was 
disabled due to some catastrophic event. Unfortunately, when they 
enabled mirroring between the two data centers, they did it wrong, so 
they essentially copied the empty one over the full one. They did 
have backups of course, but it took them a day or two to read it in, 
and in the mean time, only cash payments were possible throughout the 
country. ATMs were down too, of course, so people couldn't get cash 
to use in the stores.
