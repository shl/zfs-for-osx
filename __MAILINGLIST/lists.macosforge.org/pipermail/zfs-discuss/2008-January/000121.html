<PRE>I'm not sure that I'm clear on this part of the discussion since this  
is a base feature of the Solaris ZFS that makes it attractive.

To make sure that I'm clear on what the situation is :

I have created a raidz pool of 3x500Gb disks.  Net result, I have a  
1Tb volume that can tolerate the failure of a drive.  This is a  
perfect use case for both the SMB and home user market, what with  
exploding space requirements for video and hi-res photos etc.  But the  
day I need more storage, I plan to simple extend the raidz set using :

zpool add [-fn] &lt;pool&gt; &lt;vdev&gt;

with the addition of another drive of the same size. (tested on a  
Solaris x86 box)

Caveat : adding a 750Gb disk to a raidz set composed of 500Gb disks  
will only result in 500Gb of the new drive being used.

But the result should be that my existing pool goes from 3x500 (1Tb)  
to 4x500 (1.5Tb) and I don't have to migrate anything or move anything  
around.  Now if the point is that you're moving to another size disk  
it's more complicated.

Replacing volumes with large disks requires that you export and import  
the volume for the new capacity to be recognized and it automatically  
resilvers the raidz volume to spread out the parity blocks.

3x500 -&gt; 3x750 would be a

zpool replace [-f] &lt;pool&gt; &lt;device&gt; [new_device]

and requires an export/import for the system to recognize the new  
capacity once all of the data has been copied to the new drives  
(tested on Solaris x86 box with firewire disks)

Cheers,

Erik

Notes : my Solaris box is a crappy old Shuttle PC that's 5 years old.  
These tests are uniquely applicable to my tests on this box and I  
haven't even tried this on the current OS X ZFS port.
