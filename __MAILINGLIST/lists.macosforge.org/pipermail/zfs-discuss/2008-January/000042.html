<PRE>As you guessed,  we do have a more intelligent implementation :)

Basically, we have block birth times associated with each block and  
also &quot;dead&quot; lists (blocks that were live in a previous snapshot/fs,  
but aren't in this current snapshot/fs).
These two things help us know which blocks &quot;have changed&quot; since the  
last snapshot or event.  We will actually only bother &quot;updating&quot; the  
snapshot with blocks that have a birth time *later* than the  
snapshot.  Hence the amount of space a snapshot takes up is  
proportional to the amount of data you have changed between it and the  
live filesystem you're snap-shotting.  (I say &quot;updating&quot; in quotes  
because of how our snapshots work.  Since ZFS is COW, snapshots are  
free, since essentially when a block changes in your live filesystem,  
instead of freeing that block(as we would done if you hadn't done any  
snapshots), we keep it around.)  Visually this is like two trees that  
start out the same, but gradually diverge the more changes you make to  
your live filesystem.  A good visual of this can be seen in the  
&quot;Constant Time Snapshots&quot; slide of the ZFS Filesystem presentation on  
open solaris:

<A HREF="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/docs/zfs_last.pdf">http://opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/docs/zfs_last.pdf</A>

'zfs send' also is done at the block level.  So if you do a 'zfs send - 
i' for example, only the *blocks* that have changed between this  
snapshot and the last one will be sent over.
Incidentally, the block birth time is also what helps us know what to  
resilver in the case of a transient outage in a raidz or mirror such  
that we don't incur the overhead of having to blindly resilver the  
entire raidz or mirror.

If your're interested you can read up on how this works in more detail:
