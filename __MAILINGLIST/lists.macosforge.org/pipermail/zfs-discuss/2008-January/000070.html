<PRE>***This is a repost of a previous message posted in the wrong thread.
Please reply to this post.  Apologies.***

First, some details as to what I'm working with.  I have a raid-z pool that
I created on Solaris 10, then upgraded to OpenSolaris Nevada (upgraded the
pool as well), and then just today took the plunge and exported it to try
and import into Leopard (ZFS 102a).

Everything seemed to go very smoothly, until I needed to change ownership on
some very large folders (300+GB).  A *chown -Rv user folder* seemed to work
fine for about 2 minutes and then it hung.  I tried to break out of the
process.  Nothing.  I tried to open another terminal and force unmount the
pool.  Nothing.  I tried to eject the drives in Disk Utility.  Nothing.  So
then after waiting another 10 minutes or so I just unplugged the drives.
Nothing.

I tried to shutdown and it wouldn't shut down so I just powered off, booted
up, tried everything again with all the same results, except that this time
I tried plugging back in the drives and letting it sit.  By doing this I was
at least able to get a kernel panic out of it! ;) [I now realize from
another post that this kernel panic is most likely due to unplugging the
drives hot, so I won't be reposting the kernel panic info.]

I am also able to replicate all of this in finder with pretty much any
process (copy, move, etc.), provided the process takes long enough.

I may try this again today, leave the drives alone, and just let it sit to
see if I can get some sort of dump/panic; something to work with at least.
