Yes, this is what people *want* o happen, but it doesn't happen that  
way. Not yet.

As I understand it, you can't add devices to an existing raidz array.  
(On the ZFS that's currently shipping with Solaris, I think you can  
add on-line spares to an existing array, but that won't increase the  
storage capacity of the array.)

You *can* add storage to an existing storage *pool*, as long as the  
new elements of the pool are at least as large as the existing elements.

So in your example of a 3x500GB raidz, I *think* you could add a  
single 1TB drive to the pool, and it would stripe across the single  
drive and the raidz. Which is not what you want; the failure of the  
single 1TB drive would kill the whole pool.  So I'm not certain it  
will let you do that.

I am pretty sure it would let you add another 3x500GB raidz to the  
pool, your I/O performance would go up because you're striping between  
two arrays, and each individual array could survive the failure of one  
of its devices. You would end up with a 2 TB pool.

If you think that your Solaris box can do this, could you post the  
output of &quot;zpool status&quot; before and after adding your additional disk?

Thanks!
