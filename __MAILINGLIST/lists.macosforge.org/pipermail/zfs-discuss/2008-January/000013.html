I'm not an expert of the inner workings, but here goes:

ZFS uses a copy-on-write scheme combined with checksums and age  
counters. Using these features at the same time allows you to make  
changes of multiple blocks atomic.

Whenever you make a change to a block, that block gets copied and  
changed. Then its parent block gets copied and changed, all the way up  
to the superblock. Multiple copies of these metadata blocks are  
written btw, since they're so important.

So whenever a change was made but the super block wasn't updated  
because of a crash, that change simply doesn't exist.

If the superblock was changed but one of its child blocks didn't make  
it on disk due to write block reordering, ZFS will know that something  
happened because of the checksums. It can then react to this  
intelligently (although I don't know how it handles this particular  
situation).

Wout.
