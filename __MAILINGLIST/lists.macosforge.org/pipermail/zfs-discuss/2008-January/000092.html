<PRE>Please forgive for asking such basic questions...

First question... on the download page we are instructed to make a
backup of of a few core system files, including
/System/Library/Extensions/zfs.kext This file does not exist on any of
my my three systems (10.5.1 build 9B18). I just have zfs.readonly.kext
I assume I should back up this file and later blow it away before I
copy over build/Release/zfs.kext --- yes I know the installer that was
pulled from ADC probably deals with this... but thats now gone.

Second.... I used the getting start set-up and created a puddle on an
older drive (I also updated to version 8). I found anytime I cared to
write to the drive I needed to supply and administrator password... so
I assume I did something wrong in the setup and tried again. Same
problem, okay no issue as I'm just &quot;playing&quot; around. So I started to
copy my iTunes Library over, and it took forever and developed an
error half way thru, dismissed the error and it kept on trying to copy
the rest of the files. (I think it has to do with me not turning of
spotlight first)

Now I can't do take the drive offline as it is always busy...  `zpool
export` always fails in one way or another. I turned off spotlight and
rebooted some issues.

I finally moved the drive to my laptop where I have installed the zfs
bits and was finally about to format the drive (note I wasn't able to
reformat the drive either on the system with the new zfs bits)... and
I'm going to try all over again... after some, hopeful, wise advise.
</PRE>
