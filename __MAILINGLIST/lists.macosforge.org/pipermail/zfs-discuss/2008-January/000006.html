<PRE>Hi List!

I downloaded and sucessfully installed the latest zfs-release on my  
macpro and have a few questions.

I devoted one testdisk (160 GB) to zfs, initialised it and named it  
&quot;zfstank&quot;. I used the new zfs, not the backward-compatible ver. 6, but  
this may not be of a problem because i don't intend to use the (build- 
in) disk on other machines. So far, so good. The disc is visible in  
the finder only as a white removable drive-icon. i can copy to and  
from it, all seemed well for a beta. opening diskimages from the zfs- 
disk is ok, but closing the diskimage don't work (have to restart).

Trying to startup the same mac with another Startup-Volume (which has  
also the same zfs-build installed) didn't give me access to my zfstank- 
disc, instead it wants me to initialize it (wich i don't do). But   
going back to the other startupdisk with wich i have initialized my  
zfstank shows everything ok.

So i wonder what have i todo to make my zfstank-disk visible under  
other startup-disks?

I LOVE this new zfs-format and i want devote more discs to test it  
further. I intend do do some zraid with 3 or 4 discs (1 - 2 TB),  
mainly to use as a &quot;warehouse&quot;, copying things to and from it, (maybe  
scrubing all week to see if things went well). As startupdisk i use a  
wd raptor in the normal hfsplus-format, so the zfs-discs will have not  
much interaction with the system/finder or specific programs. All  
disks will backed up constantly on other hfs-plus discs, so i have not  
much to loose (a panic here and there would be not so welcome, but if  
the zfs-format itself is &quot;ready&quot; then i would take this risk on...

What do you all think about this? I s this scenario too dangerous, is  
it too early or could i benefit from zfs now under this circumstances?  
So, maybe you can give us a bit more info (then on the website) on  
what is NOW possible with this release and what the differences are to  
the Release in production-use by SUN.

A already downloaded several whitepapers and will learn more, what i  
would need is a more practical approach to get deeper into it on the  
copmmandline for day-to-day work, so any links to tutorials are welcome.

Thank you all for this fantastic release, hope to see the technology  
mature soon for use as the main filesystem on os x.
