</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ah well. I'm very impatient when it comes to these things :). I'd be  
pretty chuffed with just 'normal' ZFS snapshoting ability - even if it  
means I have to browse the snapshots by hand for the time being rather  
than using the fancy Time Machine UI.

&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder how this would work if you're storing things on ZFS  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly rather than working on an HFS+ volume and having Time  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Machine backup to ZFS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're working off a ZFS filesystem then life &quot;would be&quot; easy.   
</I>&gt;<i> ZFS snapshots can be taken regularly(via the command line or some  
</I>&gt;<i> future TM button) and then you can use Time Machine to browse those  
</I>&gt;<i> snapshots (or use .zfs if you are old fashioned).
</I>
Yes, that would be ideal.

&gt;<i> Also among other things we could then hook up Time Machine to use  
</I>&gt;<i> 'zfs send' and 'zfs send -i'  and 'zfs recv' to backup your  
</I>&gt;<i> snapshots to your backup volume for posterity.
</I>
Fantastic. If this functionality were made part of Time Machine that'd  
be great. Otherwise I'll be setting up some cron jobs or something to  
do the same thing.

&gt;<i> Note that you can 'zfs send' your filesystem to a file on any  
</I>&gt;<i> supported filesystem, so you can send your zfs snapshot to a file on  
</I>&gt;<i> an HFS+ backup drive if you like.  However you can only 'zfs recv'  
</I>&gt;<i> that backup into a zfs filesystem.
</I>
Quite so. If it's feasible, though, I figure I might as well zfs send  
the FS to another ZFS file system, because then I can reconstruct it  
at the other end (receive) and ZFS will check it's integrity etc. At  
the moment I have a cheap custom built PC running Solaris which I  
access via NFS. It has a ZFS RAID mirror on it. Sometimes I work  
directly from that and sometimes I rsync stuff to it.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** Keep in mind this is all hypothetical as none of this has been  
</I>&gt;<i> discussed yet, but you get the idea :)
</I>&gt;<i> Is that what you were asking or did I misinterpret your question?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Absolutely. The working directly on ZFS, periodic snapshoting and then  
using send/receive to backup to another ZFS volume somewhere over the  
network and having Time Machine provide a front end for restoring  
stuff from backup (in addition to the normal .zfs browsing option and  
along with all the usual ZFS features like clones etc) would be ideal.

I once set up an office Solaris server (cheap commodity job) with Macs  
connecting to it and using it for user home directories (via NFS) and  
set it up to snapshot all the user homes every 10 minutes (keeping the  
past 6) along with hourly and daily snapshots (the latter kept  
forever). It was great.

&gt;<i> If you are interested in details in how our snapshots work(it's  
</I>&gt;<i> pretty cool stuff), Matt Ahrens has a great blog about it:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On a different note, do you have any idea when Spotlight might be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working on nested ZFS file systems? It seems that spotlight will  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> index the root FS/pool (albeit with some bugs apparently) but not  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any FSs contained within that. Even if they're set to mount  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elsewhere.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tried moving my Home to a ZFS fs, and it mostly worked as far as  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can tell (only tried it last night), but I would miss having  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spotlight for my home folder. I could search for Mail messages  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on subject/from/to, but not the whole message :(. It was very  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useful to be able to clone my User account in a matter of seconds  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to experiment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sadly this is a known problem.  As I mentioned on the zfs page,  
</I>&gt;<i> there's still a bunch of unhappiness between ZFS and Spotlight which  
</I>&gt;<i> is causing issues which is why I currently recommend disabling it.   
</I>&gt;<i> We are trying very hard to get it up and running though since I know  
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of people really depend on Spotlight, like you mentioned, for  
</I>&gt;<i> searching home directories.  We're fixing bugs one by one, hopefully  
</I>&gt;<i> we'll achieve a happy union between the two soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Good good.

&gt;<i> As far as nested filesystems, Spotlight won't search them because we  
</I>&gt;<i> flag all nested filesystems(an fs that is not the pool fs) as  
</I>&gt;<i> MNT_DONTBROWSE.  This is for a number of reasons that basically  
</I>&gt;<i> entail us needing a tighter integration with Finder.  For example,   
</I>&gt;<i> if we don't use this flag then every filesystem you create Finder  
</I>&gt;<i> will show on your desktop, which if you have many, is really  
</I>&gt;<i> annoying.  Finder also wants to show anything filesystems it can  
</I>&gt;<i> browse in the sidebar in the Finder window.  Needless to say this  
</I>&gt;<i> kind of representation is fine for current use but doesn't scale  
</I>&gt;<i> with how ZFS is generally used (we encourage a filesystem ==   
</I>&gt;<i> directory).  The Finder window goes nuts, and well, it's just not  
</I>&gt;<i> pretty :(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hmm, I can see the problem. Is there any solution to allowing  
Spotlight to index the nested volumes then? What I'm inclined, in  
general, to do here is create a zpool and then make: pool/Users, pool/ 
Users/david, pool/Users/david/Library, pool/Users/david/Library/Caches  
[to exclude them from snapshots] etc etc - in other words quite a lot  
of nested file systems. If Spotlight can't be made to index them the  
only solution I can find is to create a pool and use the whole pool  
for my home directory. Any other nested FS would then effectively live  
in my home (although I could change mountpoints I suppose). Whether  
this could be a workable setup I'm not sure. Or can peace be made  
between Spotlight and nested zfs FSs?

Would it, perhaps, be possible to set some specific nested zfs  
filesystems to not be flagged as MNT_DONTBROWSE? If there was an  
option to override it that might be a workaround (zfs set  
enablespotlight=on pool/Users/david ???). I guess, as you say:-

&gt;<i> Please know that we are working on it and I'll continue to keep the  
</I>&gt;<i> list updated.  Thanks for using ZFS and continue sending the  
</I>&gt;<i> feedback and suggestions and questions :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No problem. I like ZFS very much indeed and I'll definitely be using  
it. Thanks for getting it working.
