So right now, zfs requires admin privileges to do all pool  
operations.  Hence when you create the pool via:
# sudo zpool create whirl /dev/disk1s2
By default admin owns it hence is the only one who can write to it.   
You can change this after creation with a simple chown -R operation on  
the pool.  For example for my pool I did:
#sudo chown -R noel:staff /Volumes/whirl
which then allows me to write to the pool as myself with no admin  
privileges.


&gt;<i> Now I can't do take the drive offline as it is always busy...  `zpool
</I>&gt;<i> export` always fails in one way or another. I turned off spotlight and
</I>&gt;<i> rebooted some issues.
</I>

This is expected if you had spotlight running on the system.  Because  
of the type of references used, you'll always have to do a force  
unmount/force export of the pool.   A 'zpool export -f whirl' should  
work fine.  Did you try that and it still wouldn't work?

&gt;<i> I finally moved the drive to my laptop where I have installed the zfs
</I>&gt;<i> bits and was finally about to format the drive (note I wasn't able to
</I>&gt;<i> reformat the drive either on the system with the new zfs bits)... and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to try all over again... after some, hopeful, wise advise.
</I>
Not sure about this, do you have more detail?  How were you trying to  
reformat the drive and what error were you getting? Note that you will  
have to 'zpool destroy' the pool that you had created previously on  
the drive *before* you try and reformat it.  Otherwise you'll get a  
'drive is in use' error.  Just unmounting or zpool exporting a zfs  
pool doesn't actually destroy it.  This functionality does differ from  
traditional unix FS so it's a little different to get used to at  
first....

Let me know if I missed any of your questions or you have any more,

Noel
