&gt;<i> Wow - does that mean that Time Machine may soon be able to use ZFS  
</I>&gt;<i> snapshots instead of HFS+ hard links? That would be awesome!
</I>
Awesome for sure, I'd be stoked;  I wouldn't hold my breath on &quot;soon&quot;  
though :)

&gt;<i> I wonder how this would work if you're storing things on ZFS  
</I>&gt;<i> directly rather than working on an HFS+ volume and having Time  
</I>&gt;<i> Machine backup to ZFS.
</I>
If you're working off a ZFS filesystem then life &quot;would be&quot; easy.  ZFS  
snapshots can be taken regularly(via the command line or some future  
TM button) and then you can use Time Machine to browse those snapshots  
(or use .zfs if you are old fashioned).   Also among other things we  
could then hook up Time Machine to use 'zfs send' and 'zfs send -i'   
and 'zfs recv' to backup your snapshots to your backup volume for  
posterity.  Note that you can 'zfs send' your filesystem to a file on  
any supported filesystem, so you can send your zfs snapshot to a file  
on an HFS+ backup drive if you like.  However you can only 'zfs recv'  
that backup into a zfs filesystem.
** Keep in mind this is all hypothetical as none of this has been  
discussed yet, but you get the idea :)
Is that what you were asking or did I misinterpret your question?

If you are interested in details in how our snapshots work(it's pretty  
cool stuff), Matt Ahrens has a great blog about it:

&gt;<i> On a different note, do you have any idea when Spotlight might be  
</I>&gt;<i> working on nested ZFS file systems? It seems that spotlight will  
</I>&gt;<i> index the root FS/pool (albeit with some bugs apparently) but not  
</I>&gt;<i> any FSs contained within that. Even if they're set to mount elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tried moving my Home to a ZFS fs, and it mostly worked as far as I  
</I>&gt;<i> can tell (only tried it last night), but I would miss having  
</I>&gt;<i> spotlight for my home folder. I could search for Mail messages based  
</I>&gt;<i> on subject/from/to, but not the whole message :(. It was very useful  
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to clone my User account in a matter of seconds to  
</I>&gt;<i> experiment.
</I>
Sadly this is a known problem.  As I mentioned on the zfs page,  
there's still a bunch of unhappiness between ZFS and Spotlight which  
is causing issues which is why I currently recommend disabling it.  We  
are trying very hard to get it up and running though since I know a  
lot of people really depend on Spotlight, like you mentioned, for  
searching home directories.  We're fixing bugs one by one, hopefully  
we'll achieve a happy union between the two soon.

As far as nested filesystems, Spotlight won't search them because we  
flag all nested filesystems(an fs that is not the pool fs) as  
MNT_DONTBROWSE.  This is for a number of reasons that basically entail  
us needing a tighter integration with Finder.  For example,  if we  
don't use this flag then every filesystem you create Finder will show  
on your desktop, which if you have many, is really annoying.  Finder  
also wants to show anything filesystems it can browse in the sidebar  
in the Finder window.  Needless to say this kind of representation is  
fine for current use but doesn't scale with how ZFS is generally used  
(we encourage a filesystem ==  directory).  The Finder window goes  
nuts, and well, it's just not pretty :(

Please know that we are working on it and I'll continue to keep the  
list updated.  Thanks for using ZFS and continue sending the feedback  
and suggestions and questions :)
