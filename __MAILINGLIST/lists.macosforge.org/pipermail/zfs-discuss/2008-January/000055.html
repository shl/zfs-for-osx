<PRE>Currently we haven't done *any* performance work yet, other then  
general benchmarking along the way to make sure we haven't gone off  
the deep end or are performing horribly.  So be warned you're probably  
not going to see the best numbers as no work has been done in this area.

As far as benchmarking, just to keep track we've been using just some  
general benchmarks like postmark, dbench, and such in addition to  
timing certain commands (like a ls -lR of a large hierarchy for  
example). Are you looking for something or debugging something  
specific? Or just general?

Depending on what you're doing of course there are a variety of  
tools.   Eventually when Dtrace works on kexts, you can also use that  
to do perf work.  Two zfs specific tools you can use are:
- the 'zpool iostat' command to see io rates split up by pool.  There  
are a variety of options you use for it depending on what you want to  
look at
- the 'zoink' tool if you're interested in memory management and  
footprint info for ZFS

p.s. We will have the option of having case insensitive zfs  
filesystems soon (as a settable property via 'zfs set') in which case  
you can run your games out of that filesystem which should help the  
case sensitive grumbles.
