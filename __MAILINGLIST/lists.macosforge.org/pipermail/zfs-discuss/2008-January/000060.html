Sorry about that... the GCC 4.0 doesn't do &quot;native&quot; for mtune. It's  
just an optimization thing, it might not even be important.

In general, when faced with some lousy options that a wacko on a  
mailing list suggests, just try running &quot;configure&quot; without any  
options. So you might start with

./configure
make
sudo make install

  and that should work.


For Apple's GCC 4.0 on Leopard, running on a 64-bit Intel Mac, you  
could try this:

/configure CFLAGS=&quot;-Os -ftree-vectorize -pipe -fPIC -arch x86_64 -Wl,- 
pie&quot;

I think the 64-bit option was worth mentioning for 2.x versions of  
rsync, becuase there were reports of 32-bit rsync actually *running  
out of memory* when traversing large hierarchies. Good grief. That  
means it grabbed more than two gigabytes of real RAM before the kernel  
killed it. Clearly that's pathological.  The 3.0 version of rsync  
seems to manage large hierarchies a bit at a time, and probably you  
don't need the 64-bit version so much. And the 64-bit version wouldn't  
run on my MacBook Pro (for instance, a not-Core-2 machine).

So if you are still reading this, you might try not setting the CFLAGS  
and probably it will work fine.

Sorry we're clogging up a ZFS list with rsync issues. But maybe I can  
find some overlap -- note that you can push snapshots from one ZFS  
array to another with zpool export/import. I wonder how my remote  
backup and mirroring strategies are going to change... I may not use  
rsync in the future, and just use ZFS!

Hope this helps!

   - boyd
