(Okay, posting a third time, this time manually adding <A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">zfs-discuss at ...</A>
to the addresses)

Good question.  I'll refer you to a good and complete answer:

<A HREF="http://drewthaler.blogspot.com/2007/12/case-against-insensitivity.html">http://drewthaler.blogspot.com/2007/12/case-against-insensitivity.html</A>

Note that your specific &quot;grandmother&quot; example (and Mr. Palmer's stated
example) is almost exactly replicated (and explained) under the 4th
subheading titled &quot;Case-insensitivity is a layering violation.&quot;

My intention was not to start a flamewar... and I encourage Mr. Palmer
to read the linked post above...
