Adrian,

	You hit the nail on the head - if you think that case insensitivity  
is a UI improvement, then do it in the UI, NOT in the filesystem.  The  
filesystem should maintain as much state as possible, and keep that  
state as relevant as possible - once you throw something away, you  
can't get it back.  It also means that a lot of FS activity which the  
system depends on (but not the user) will be burdened by the  
translations you want done.   If there is a win to what you want, do  
it at the UI layer, and only take that burden for user filesystem  
interactions (which are a small percentage of the overall filesystem  
burden).

	Also, if you make a file system case insensitive, then those of us  
who want case sensitivity are screwed, as you have already turfed the  
data that case sensitivity requires.  If it's a UI function, then the  
data is there, and you can decide if you want it mangled, or straight  
(i.e. a preference).

	Chris

</I>&gt;<i> From a developer's point of view, I'm sure  that article is very

</I>&gt;<i> number of points about layering violations. Please allow me to clarify
</I>&gt;<i> my point of view, however, with a couple quotations:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
</I>&gt;<i> magic.&quot; - Arthur C. Clarke
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently
</I>&gt;<i> advanced.&quot; - Gehm's Corollary
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would say that Gehm's Corollary is almost a mantra when it comes to
</I>&gt;<i> Apple products. Apple makes products which are amazingly advanced, and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore amazingly easy and almost pleasurable for the end-user to
</I>&gt;<i> make use of - that's why many of us are Mac fans in the first place!
</I>&gt;<i> As I mentioned, this sort of thing is no doubt a mammoth undertaking.
</I>&gt;<i> Drew Thaler states in his article that &quot;Case-insensitivity adds
</I>&gt;<i> complexity and provides no actual benefit.&quot; Who says it provides no
</I>&gt;<i> actual benefit? The end-user sees a benefit. Ok, so it's a &quot;layering
</I>&gt;<i> violation.&quot; Who defines these layers, and why are they so important?
</I>&gt;<i> Did God send them down to us on stone tablets? What about FUSE? *nix
</I>&gt;<i> geeks hate FUSE because it's a blatant &quot;layering violation.&quot; And so
</I>&gt;<i> what? Isn't the end-goal of computers to provide a function we desire?
</I>&gt;<i> Surely there are no rules about how this HAS to be done. The end-goal
</I>&gt;<i> is to provide a user experience that will accomplish the job, and
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully not be too painful in doing so. ZFS itself does away with
</I>&gt;<i> such outdated paradigms as the separation of volumes and filesystems.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes we need to ignore the &quot;rules&quot; when the spirit behind them is
</I>&gt;<i> lost; rules only exist to lead the way to a better world for the
</I>&gt;<i> populace. When they interfere with that, what purpose do they hold?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To re-hash some things I've already mentioned: I'm not a developer. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't FULLY understand the nuts and bolts of these things. Also, I do
</I>&gt;<i> sympathize with the difficulties of writing a lot of code in a
</I>&gt;<i> language computers understand, in order to shift the UI closer to
</I>&gt;<i> something that HUMANS understand. I also understand from the countless
</I>&gt;<i> days I've spent learning how to use various *nix systems that the
</I>&gt;<i> developer intelligentsia doesn't have a lot of sympathy for us n00bs -
</I>&gt;<i> ask a question, and they just say RTFM. One soon finds that &quot;TFM&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> written BY codies FOR codies, and is of little use to someone not in
</I>&gt;<i> the know. Now, is the answer REALLY to tell end-users, &quot;no, we're not
</I>&gt;<i> going to spend the time making a system that's easy to use; it's your
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility to learn the technical arcana yourself&quot;? I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> so. I think we should take a page from the Humane Interface folks and
</I>&gt;<i> try to make computers interact with humans on a human level. It really
</I>&gt;<i> is true that &quot;Any technology distinguishable from magic is
</I>&gt;<i> insufficiently advanced.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry, developer folks. I know it's a tough pill to swallow. All I
</I>&gt;<i> can say is that I really appreciate the work you do, and I hope you
</I>&gt;<i> don't get too worn down trying to make these machines act the way that
</I>&gt;<i> real humans do.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A brief break from lurking, and I was wondering what the issue is

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> case-insensitivity? I mean, from a non-developer's point of view
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (mine), I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not sure I would even want case-sensitivity. To the average end-

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> FOLDER, folder, Folder, foldeR, folDer, ad nauseum, should all be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the same
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> folder. As a case example, imagine your grandmother is filing e-
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cards she
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> has received at Christmas, and she created a folder in her
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Documents folder
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> called &quot;Christmas Cards.&quot; The next year she creates one called
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Christmas
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cards&quot; without looking first. When she looks back in one of those
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> folders,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> she's suddenly in a panic that she can't find one year's e-cards,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> freaking
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> out that she's &quot;broken her computer&quot;, and next thing you know I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have to go
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to Grandma's place to explain about case-sensitivity for like the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> eighteenth
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> time. Doesn't this just add unnecessary complication?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Just hoping to have it explained, really. From my brief forays into
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the *nix
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> world, I've noticed that the average Joe wants computers to be more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> human-like, developers want them to be more technical, and neither
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> party is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particularly fond of the other. Isn't there some middle ground?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Okay, posting a third time, this time manually adding zfs-

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note that your specific &quot;grandmother&quot; example (and Mr. Palmer's
