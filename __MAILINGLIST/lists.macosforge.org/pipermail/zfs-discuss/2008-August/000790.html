<PRE>It blows my mind that anyone actually wants case insensitivity..
I don't think grandma is going to be opening the terminal and creating 
any zpools or running 10.6 server on her imac anytime in the near future 
so I don't see this as an issue.

The case sensitivity dataset is important so that I can use ZFS &amp; crappy 
applications that fail at case sensitivity at the same time and without 
wasting space on a second partition. That sure would be nice....I'm 
looking at you Blizzard.

At the end of the day the point is moot, regardless of your preference 
zfs lets you do it both ways, and since it's not going to be the default 
fs in client (or probably even available at all outside of the command 
line) worrying about grandma is just a waste of time.......so...why are 
we all still talking about it? :-)

One last point, The idea of just changing to case sensitivity to force 
developers to make applications that don't suck isn't realiastic. Users 
are stupid, users will say &quot;this program worked in 10.5 and now it 
doesn't work in 10.6, i'm mad and 10.6 sucks.&quot; a quick google search 
will return lots of other broken apps that don't work and then &quot;10.6 
sucks&quot; will become a new theme. Soon microsoft will be running &quot;pc, mac&quot; 
commercials where mac guy starts talking about users upgrading to an 
older version to run photoshop and WoW...
