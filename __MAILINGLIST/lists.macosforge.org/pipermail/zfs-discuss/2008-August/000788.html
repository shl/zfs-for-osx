<PRE>Sorry, I originally meant to post to the list, not directly to Nathan.  
But thanks for the cross-post to the list!

 From a developer's point of view, I'm sure  that article is very  
valid. The adaptation of case-INsensitivity to various languages is no  
doubt a monumental problem. The author of the article also makes a  
number of points about layering violations. Please allow me to clarify  
my point of view, however, with a couple quotations:

&quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from  
magic.&quot; - Arthur C. Clarke
&quot;Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently  
advanced.&quot; - Gehm's Corollary

I would say that Gehm's Corollary is almost a mantra when it comes to  
Apple products. Apple makes products which are amazingly advanced, and  
therefore amazingly easy and almost pleasurable for the end-user to  
make use of - that's why many of us are Mac fans in the first place!  
As I mentioned, this sort of thing is no doubt a mammoth undertaking.   
Drew Thaler states in his article that &quot;Case-insensitivity adds  
complexity and provides no actual benefit.&quot; Who says it provides no  
actual benefit? The end-user sees a benefit. Ok, so it's a &quot;layering  
violation.&quot; Who defines these layers, and why are they so important?  
Did God send them down to us on stone tablets? What about FUSE? *nix  
geeks hate FUSE because it's a blatant &quot;layering violation.&quot; And so  
what? Isn't the end-goal of computers to provide a function we desire?  
Surely there are no rules about how this HAS to be done. The end-goal  
is to provide a user experience that will accomplish the job, and  
hopefully not be too painful in doing so. ZFS itself does away with  
such outdated paradigms as the separation of volumes and filesystems.  
Sometimes we need to ignore the &quot;rules&quot; when the spirit behind them is  
lost; rules only exist to lead the way to a better world for the  
populace. When they interfere with that, what purpose do they hold?

To re-hash some things I've already mentioned: I'm not a developer. I  
don't FULLY understand the nuts and bolts of these things. Also, I do  
sympathize with the difficulties of writing a lot of code in a  
language computers understand, in order to shift the UI closer to  
something that HUMANS understand. I also understand from the countless  
days I've spent learning how to use various *nix systems that the  
developer intelligentsia doesn't have a lot of sympathy for us n00bs -  
ask a question, and they just say RTFM. One soon finds that &quot;TFM&quot; is  
written BY codies FOR codies, and is of little use to someone not in  
the know. Now, is the answer REALLY to tell end-users, &quot;no, we're not  
going to spend the time making a system that's easy to use; it's your  
responsibility to learn the technical arcana yourself&quot;? I don't think  
so. I think we should take a page from the Humane Interface folks and  
try to make computers interact with humans on a human level. It really  
is true that &quot;Any technology distinguishable from magic is  
insufficiently advanced.&quot;

I'm sorry, developer folks. I know it's a tough pill to swallow. All I  
can say is that I really appreciate the work you do, and I hope you  
don't get too worn down trying to make these machines act the way that  
real humans do.
