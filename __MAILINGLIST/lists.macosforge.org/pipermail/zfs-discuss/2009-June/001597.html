<PRE>I am writing after receiving a fixed external enclosure which has  
solved my previous problem (quoted email below).  My pool now starts  
up correctly however it looks like it is operating without two disks:

g5:~ bobcat$ zpool status -v
   pool: cpool
  state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices could not be used because the label is  
missing or
	invalid.  Sufficient replicas exist for the pool to continue
	functioning in a degraded state.
action: Replace the device using 'zpool replace'.

errors: No known data errors

Looking in Disk Utility I see all seven disks in the array are  
recognized by OSX.  Is it possible that swapping drives around when  
switching to the new enclosure has caused some to not be found by  
ZFS?  Or maybe more likely that one or two died in the meantime?  Is  
there a way to identify which the two drives that are FAULTED and  
UNAVAIL are to easily swap them out or try readding them to the pool?

I realize this isn't strictly a OSX ZFS issue, but this seems like the  
best place to ask.

Thanks Much,

Carl
