<PRE>&quot;usually the FS wins&quot;? Could you please provide examples?

Personally, I'm thinking of moving my 4-drive ZFS array over to a 4- 
drive Drobo. There, I've said it! :-)

I've been running the ZFS seeds since they first appeared in Leopard  
pre-releases, but if I'm going to be unable to upgrade to Snow Leopard  
because my movies and music are on an unsupported filesystem, the  
filesystem is what's going to get replaced, not my OS.

If anyone has any feedback, good or bad, on using a Drobo for non- 
critical mass storage, please email me (or post if you think it's  
appropriate). I've read good things and bad things, but having  
personally lost a terabyte of data to ZFS by not following the correct  
half of the two different instructions in the Mac ZFS readme... I have  
two coworkers who recently started using a 4-drive Drobo and an 8- 
drive Drobo, respectively, and they're quite happy so far.
