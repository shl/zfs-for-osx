Sure, I did not want you _write_ to them :)

&gt;<i> but doing a &quot;dd if=/dev/disk9&quot; or &quot;dd if/dev/disk9s1&quot; prints a bunch of junk

</I>
s2 is usually the &quot;whole disk&quot;, not sure why OSX returns &quot;Resource busy&quot; 
sometimes (it does this here too for some disks).

&gt;<i> They do both show up diskutil.  I guess my concern is that I'm not sure if

</I>
Well, they show up in diskutil. Is their layout not different from the 
other disks? What about their contents? Try &quot;file -s /dev/disk8*&quot; and it 
will guess what's on the partitions, maybe that will make you recognize 
them as &quot;the right disks&quot;.

&gt;<i> maybe two of my other disks are labeled disk[8/9] now and I wouldn't want to
</I>&gt;<i> accidentally overwrite them. Do you know if there is any way to confirm this -
</I>&gt;<i> which disks are actually associated with which volumes?
</I>
system_profiler lists the hardware in/attached to your system, you could 
look up the disk model or the serial# on your disk and then search for it:

--------------------
$ system_profiler | less
[...]
          Capacity: 55.89 GB
          Model: Hitachi HTS541060G9AT00
          Revision: MB3AA5AJ
          Serial Number: MPB350X5G98HVC
[...]
  File System: Journaled HFS+
              BSD Name: disk0s3
              Mount Point: /
---------------------

&gt;<i> I'm also a little
</I>&gt;<i> unsure how I wold reintegrate them in my raid (format them like I was creating
</I>&gt;<i> a pool from scratch, and add them to the existing pool?).
</I>
Well, ZFS told you to:

---------------------
g5:~ bobcat$ zpool status -v
 pool: cpool
state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices could not be used because the label is missing
        or invalid.  Sufficient replicas exist for the pool to continue
        functioning in a degraded state.
action: Replace the device using 'zpool replace'.

---------------------

I think this is the way to go here. If thing go wrong, you still have your 
backups, right? :-)

Christian.
