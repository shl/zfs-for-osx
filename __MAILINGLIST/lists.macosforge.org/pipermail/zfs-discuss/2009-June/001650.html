<PRE>e 12 juin 2009 &#224; 19:50, Dillon Kass a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> You should wait until 10.6 is released. I find it very unlikely that  
</I>&gt;<i> ZFS is really gone. I find it more likely that it has been pulled  
</I>&gt;<i> from the official release because something wasn't ready and they  
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to officially support it. They will likely update the  
</I>&gt;<i> macosforge page upon release.
</I>
ZFS is not in the latest GM build from WWDC. I think that we can  
consider that it will not be a core OS component as part of the  
standard install. I don't have the Server version yet so I'll have to  
check that out.

&gt;<i> There were significant updates to ZFS in some of the 10.6 betas  
</I>&gt;<i> before it was pulled and I can't imagine throwing away all that work  
</I>&gt;<i> when it's already done. Not to mention a decent amount of folks at  
</I>&gt;<i> Apple are Unix geeks and are probably just as excited about ZFS as  
</I>&gt;<i> the rest of us are.
</I>
The work certainly won't be thrown away, but it won't be seen as an  
integrated component until 10.6.x or more likely 10.7.  It's possible  
that they will release it as a standalone package with a separate  
marketing message since generally point releases are not permitted to  
include important new functionality.

I expect that the unsupported beta releases on macosforge will reopen  
after 10.6 hits in September.

Cheers,

Erik
Note - I don't have any kind of inside information - just ideas and  
opinions based on dealing with Apple for a long time.

</I>&gt;<i> This isn't that dissimilar to 10.5, If anyone recalls some early  
</I>&gt;<i> 10.5 betas had ZFS support and then it was pulled as we got close to  
</I>&gt;<i> the release just to show up in it's current unoffically supported  
</I>&gt;<i> form after release.
