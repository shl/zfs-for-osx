<PRE>&gt;<i> If anyone has any feedback, good or bad, on using a Drobo for non- 
</I>&gt;<i> critical mass storage, please email me (or post if you think it's  
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate). I've read good things and bad things, but having  
</I>&gt;<i> personally lost a terabyte of data to ZFS by not following the  
</I>&gt;<i> correct half of the two different instructions in the Mac ZFS  
</I>&gt;<i> readme... I have two coworkers who recently started using a 4-drive  
</I>&gt;<i> Drobo and an 8-drive Drobo, respectively, and they're quite happy so  
</I>&gt;<i> far.

We've used them quite a lot for small-mid sized studios and they can  
occasionally go a bit nuts (we've had them repeatedly crash on large  
file transfers).  The 2nd gen ones (with firewire) seem a lot better  
and the big benefit is that they're very user-manageable in that you  
can give end-users some pretty straightforward instructions.  They're  
not particularly fast though.  FWIW we're actually looking at doing  
the opposite and moving to ZFS from a Drobo for some clients with  
10.6.  The current build from macosforge is pretty old, so even if  
Apple don't include ZFS officially with Snow Leopard Server I'm pretty  
positive that we'll get a new build at least which apart from anything  
else adds a year or more of development time onto the current  
publically available build.
