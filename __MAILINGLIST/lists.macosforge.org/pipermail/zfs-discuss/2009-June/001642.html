<PRE>You should wait until 10.6 is released. I find it very unlikely that ZFS 
is really gone. I find it more likely that it has been pulled from the 
official release because something wasn't ready and they don't want to 
officially support it. They will likely update the macosforge page upon 
release.

There were significant updates to ZFS in some of the 10.6 betas before 
it was pulled and I can't imagine throwing away all that work when it's 
already done. Not to mention a decent amount of folks at Apple are Unix 
geeks and are probably just as excited about ZFS as the rest of us are.

This isn't that dissimilar to 10.5, If anyone recalls some early 10.5 
betas had ZFS support and then it was pulled as we got close to the 
release just to show up in it's current unoffically supported form after 
release.

That said, I would go with FreeBSD. If you're familiar with it... 
7-STABLE (which will become 7.3) has a much improved ZFS implementation. 
ZFS v13, very fast, very stable, ZFS boot on GPT &amp; MBR is supported (I 
have personally tested both, though the procedure is probably over the 
head of anyone who isn't familiar with the specifics of FreeBSD). You 
will be able to import your pools from OS-X.

NOTE: 7.2-RELEASE which is what normal users would use has ZFS v6 which 
will not work with your OS-X pool if you have upgraded it to v8. You 
must use 7-STABLE which is a development branch. This is probably over 
your head if you're not familiar with FreeBSD. Though if you have enough 
years of Linux experience you should be able to keep up just fine. If 
that turns you off OpenSolaris is a good alternative but the learning 
curve is steep and the clusterfuck of solaris &amp; gnu tools needs another 
year or two of polishing if you ask me. I'd rather use SXCE, at least I 
don't have to worry about shitty gnu ls not understanding my ACL's.

Relax and wait until September.
