&gt;<i> Hello All,

You probably had the space taken up with snapshots etc. Given that ZFS  
doesn't delete your file (but rather write a new entry saying it's not  
there any more) you can paradoxicly not have enough space to delete  
files.

Quotas can help and sometimes root can access areas normal users  
can't, but by then I suspect it wouldn't help with ZFS anyway.

&gt;<i> The only thing i could do is use my usbdisk to add some space to the

</I>&gt;<i> I want to remove my usbstick from the zpool.
</I>
Unfortunately what you have done is extended the size of the pool, and  
since it isn't mirrored (but rather striped) it's now a permanent  
part. Whilst it would be feasible for a hypothetical tool to exist to  
ensure that no snapshots are part of the pool on a device and thus be  
able to remove it, that tool doesn't exist.

&gt;<i> i also tried to export the pool, remove the usbstick from my Mac and  
</I>&gt;<i> then import the pool again, but this gives also an error.
</I>
The reason you can't is because it is a necessary part of the pool.

&gt;<i> Can anybody help?
</I>
I doubt this has helped :-)

What you can do now is either

1) Use an external disk and zfs send/receive your snapshots to, re- 
create the DataStore pool and copy your data back with zfs send/receive
2) Add a mirror of the disk+usb on an external drive, then do a  
replace with that image
3) Live with the USB as part of your setup

Note that this isn't much different to if you had added another disk  
into a different RAID1 setup - adding is easy, removing is very  
difficult. ZFS might make it easy to add, but removing is tricky.  
However, zfs's send/receive make it much easier to rebuild an array  
when needed.
