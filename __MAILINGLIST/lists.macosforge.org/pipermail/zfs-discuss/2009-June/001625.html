Sad but true. Bear in mind there were a few kernel-ish changes needed
to get a decent ZFS implementation together; it may be that they
didn't have time to incorporate some of those. I live in hope that
Noel or similar is reading this, and wants to say &quot;when 10.6 is
released, we'll update the bits on zfs.macosforge.org again&quot; but given
that I'm typing this on a G5 computer (sob) I'm not setting
expectations too high.

I would expect that there would be *some* ZFS bits, like we've had
already, but not necessarily in a formal release. Bear in mind that
ZFS was only ever advertised on the server stuff anyway (though it was
RO in client before) probably because the GUI was going to be
server-side specific. It may be that the .kext works OK but that the
GUI wasn't up to scratch so they've taken it off the feature list.

I'd really be surprised if Apple were walking away from ZFS
permanently though, and I guess if it doesn't make it then the ZFS mac
forge stuff is still available to hack ...
