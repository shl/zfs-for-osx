This is a known and annoying problem that I have a bug open on but  
haven't been able to get to since it's rather low on the stack.  Hence  
rebooting is your only refuge when you change the kext.

If it was an application that relies on mmap then yes.  This still  
won't fix programs or apps that have case insensitivity issues or  
Finder issues, but those are still being worked on.

&gt;<i> Keep up the great work!

thanks!!! :)
