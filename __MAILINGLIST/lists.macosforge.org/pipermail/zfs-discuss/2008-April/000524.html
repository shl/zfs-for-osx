I was thinking about using TM on my RAID.Z, as well, but in the end  
decided against it, because I couldn't find a way to make use of the  
advantages ZFS gives me, especially with block based snapshots.

My backup strategy (for 6 Macs) is now a simple perl script that uses  
rsync to copy the home directory of each computer into its file system  
on the RAID.Z (via ssh, 3 computers remote via ADSL). It overwrites or  
deletes every file which has changed or is no longer in the source,  
but makes a snapshot after every run.

The script is scheduled to run every 3 hours, and most of the time, it  
even transmits huge files like the Parallels HD image (~15GB) -  
nonetheless, neither the transmission takes a long time (thanks to  
rsync) nor does it use a lot of space (thanks to ZFS) - most snapshots  
are within 100MB (considering the home dirs are about 60GB each).

I am not yet ready to put the home directory on my notebooks on ZFS,  
but this (for me) is the next best thing.
