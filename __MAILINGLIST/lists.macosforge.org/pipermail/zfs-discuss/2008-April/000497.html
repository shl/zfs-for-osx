<PRE>Still occuring in the latest build (ZFS 103)... :(

</I>&gt;<i> First, some details as to what I'm working with.  I have a raid-z pool
</I>&gt;<i> that I created on Solaris 10, then upgraded to OpenSolaris Nevada (upgraded
</I>&gt;<i> the pool as well), and then just today took the plunge and exported it to
</I>&gt;<i> try and import into Leopard (ZFS 102a).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everything seemed to go very smoothly, until I needed to change ownership
</I>&gt;<i> on some very large folders (300+GB).  A *chown -Rv user folder* seemed to
</I>&gt;<i> work fine for about 2 minutes and then it hung.  I tried to break out of the
</I>&gt;<i> process.  Nothing.  I tried to open another terminal and force unmount the
</I>&gt;<i> pool.  Nothing.  I tried to eject the drives in Disk Utility.  Nothing.  So
</I>&gt;<i> then after waiting another 10 minutes or so I just unplugged the drives.
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tried to shutdown and it wouldn't shut down so I just powered off,
</I>&gt;<i> booted up, tried everything again with all the same results, except that
</I>&gt;<i> this time I tried plugging back in the drives and letting it sit.  By doing
</I>&gt;<i> this I was at least able to get a kernel panic out of it! ;) [I now realize
</I>&gt;<i> from another post that this kernel panic is most likely due to unplugging
</I>&gt;<i> the drives hot, so I won't be reposting the kernel panic info.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am also able to replicate all of this in finder with pretty much any
</I>&gt;<i> process (copy, move, etc.), provided the process takes long enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I may try this again today, leave the drives alone, and just let it sit to
</I>&gt;<i> see if I can get some sort of dump/panic; something to work with at least.
