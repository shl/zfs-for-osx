<PRE>Hi,

I've been storing my VMWare fusion machines on my ZFS volume for some  
time, so that I can cheaply snapshot and clone them at will for one  
thing. The one problem I had with this was that they wouldn't suspend  
and resume properly. (not when I did any snapshots or clones anyway).  
I presume this is because zfs-102A isn't mmap coherent as Noel says.

In the course of trying to keep down the size of some snapshots I've  
found a workaround though. If you add in the following line to a VMX  
config file:-
	mainMem.useNamedFile = &quot;false&quot;

It stops VMWare from using a named mem file in the VM directory (on  
ZFS). It puts it somewhere else instead I think. This seems to keep  
VMWare happy as far as suspend/resume is concerned on ZFS. I even seem  
to be able, now to:-
	1. start up a VM from ZFS
	2. suspend it
	3. do a zfs snapshot
	4. clone it
	5. start up the cloned VM (VMware asks whether it was copied or moved  
and I click copied).
	6. start up the original VM

This is really incredibly useful. It uses much less disk space than  
just copying the whole VM directory.
