<PRE>SUMMARY
During the following situations:
git reset --hard &lt;revision&gt;
git-svn clone ... (on a large svn repository)
(sometimes followed by)
rm -rf &lt;some directory&gt; (after just working with a lot of files, like
one of the above commands)

The listed git commands sometimes fail, sometimes succeed, citing
sometimes missing files.  With rm -rf, shortly after the operation an
ls or other file operation will sometimes show certain
directories/files just operated on and sometimes not.  This may or may
not stabilize in the subsequent seconds.  This behavior leaves me with
the sense that the file operations are talking to different threads
associated with ZFS and that they're not all on the &quot;same page&quot;

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Find a rather large svn repository, with lots of revisions and
files (or make one).  The repo I'm working with has lots of binary
files in it and the db for svn is around 9 gigabytes with 4000
revisions or so.
2. Install latest git w/ svn support from macports. (sudo port install git +svn)
3. do a git-svn clone on your repository
4. With the current version of git-svn, it should try and repack files
at different stages during the clone process if you have enough
revisions, you will likely see a failure after this point when it
tries to pick up and check out the next increment from svn.
5. Quickly look for the files it says it cannot find in the .git
directory of your partial clone, you should find that sometimes it is
there and sometimes not.

RESULTS
Files associated with recent large batches of operations are there/not
there with subsequent &quot;ls&quot; listings.  If no new userland operations
are pending on the file, the file should either be there or not there,
not in limbo.

REGRESSION
I haven't checked this with 102A or other revs, just 111.

NOTES
Running current 111 release on a MacBook, with a single pool on a
single partition.
