<PRE>Noel,
 
    We use the array as a storage medium for an electronic discovery archiving application (indexing hard drives, etc.)  The left side is a MySQL database, only 125GB of 1.25TB is used, and the right side is raw file storage (up to 60M distinct files) taking up anywhere from 2TB to 4TB.  My main complaint right now is that turning on HFS journaling destroys the performance of the array, but turning it off causes sometimes catastrophic filesystem corruptions -- I'm dealing with one of those now, in fact.  I'm looking for additional performance and stability for this most important system.
 
Thanks,
Ben

Subject: Re: [zfs-discuss] ZFS on an XServe RAID


Awesome!  So I'd definitely recommend converting all the disks to JBOD and letting ZFS do all the raid work since then we can do end to end checksums and can heal any corrupted blocks we detect.  As to the configuration, it really depends on what you want to do with the machine.  What do you use it for? are you more interested in performance or replication and safety? 
How much space do you need to get out of the machine?

We have an Xraid here at work that I've configured, and the drives in it are really old so I don't trust them, hence I went for extreme replication (it's a server and extreme perf isn't dire).  I did a pool of two groups of raidz-2 (6 drives each) and then added a hotspare to each group. 

Most generally I'd say you'd be good with configuring a pool with 2 groups of raidz's (7 -250GB in one and 7- 700GB in the other), with that you'll get good performance with still some replication while only losing 950GB overall for replication cost (parity).  If you wanted to be more cautious, you could also do the same config but use raidz2 instead raidz so that you could withstand more disk failures, but you'll lose more storage to your parity.  There's a ton on configs, which really depend on your workload, preference, perfomance needs, and storage needs.  I'd recommend checking out the best practices guide which has a section on how to consider configuring your pool:

Roch Bourbonnais of Sun also has a blog on when or when not to use raidz:

and please feel free to ask me as well if you have more questions about a config too.  It just really depends on what you need to use it for :)

	Hello,
	 
	  I currently have an XServe RAID box with all 14 drive slots filled (left side is 250GB, right side is 700GB disks.)  In the future when ZFS is more stable and enterprise friendly, how would be the best way to deploy ZFS?  Convert all the disks to JBOD and have RAIDZ do the raiding, or let the XServe RAID do RAID5 and put ZFS on that?
	 
	Thanks for the info,
	Ben
