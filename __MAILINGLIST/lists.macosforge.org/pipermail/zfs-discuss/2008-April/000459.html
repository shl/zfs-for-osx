This is great news! The lack of a .zfs is a bit odd, and difficult to
demonstrate to naysayers how useful the idea of snapshots can be until
you've actually seen the .zfs in action.

Quick bit of feedback about .zfs - the 'rsync' program has an -C or
--cvs-exclude, which sets an exclude list to ignore certain
directories:

              The exclude list is initialized to:

              RCS SCCS CVS  CVS.adm  RCSLOG  cvslog.*  tags  TAGS  .make.state
              .nse_depinfo  *~ #* .#* ,* _$* *$ *.old *.bak *.BAK *.orig *.rej
              .del-* *.a *.olb *.o *.obj *.so *.exe *.Z *.elc *.ln core .svn/

I see that it's got .svn/ in there; I think a great addition would be
.zfs/ so that when you're rsync'ing across multiple directories you
don't get accidental snapshots carried with you.

And as for ZFS booting ... well, when that happens I'm not going back!

&gt;<i> We're also trying to mow through panics as
</I>&gt;<i> they come up (we don't have many other than ones that all seem to be related
</I>&gt;<i> to traversing large data heirarchies) which we are still trying to nail
</I>&gt;<i> down.
</I>
I've seen more than a few panics but mostly these are related to
taking out the underling disks. It's a bit annoying to have a panic -
it will be great when we have the 'failmode' property that means we
can fail a little more elegantly than a system shutdown.

&gt;<i> On the whole though, I'd give it a go.  If you've  got something specific let me know.  Feedback is always awesome.
</I>
I speak for myself here, but I'm sure that the others on the list will
agree that you guys are doing a great job in bringing a great file
system to the Mac. Here's looking forward to His Jobness announcing
that everyone should test on ZFS in WWDC because it's going to be the
new default file system for the future. (Oh wait, Jonathan Schwartz
already said that.)

Seriously, you're doing a great service to the Mac community, and I
applaud you :-)
