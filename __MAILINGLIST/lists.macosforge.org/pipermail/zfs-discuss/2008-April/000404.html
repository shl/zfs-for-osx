<PRE>About a year ago, I put a Solaris box together to play with ZFS. I
mainly use it to serve my iTunes library and DVD rips. I used samba
for this, and I was continually frustrated by its flakiness. Both
samba and Solaris's built-in smb server don't seem to play well with
the other computers in my house (all of which are Macs).

I finally bit the bullet and bought a Mac Pro (I'd been needing a new
desktop for a while) and I decided I'd try to migrate the zpool to my
new machine. The problem is that I upgraded my Solaris machine rather
frequently and now when I try to 'zpool import storage' I get this
message: cannot import 'storage': pool is formatted using a newer ZFS
version

I kept my Solaris machine pretty current. It has Nevada release 84 and
the zpool format is whatever was most current for that release. I
don't remember which version it is off the top of my head.

Is there any way for me to get my zfs volume running under OS X? I
read the FAQ and it seems to suggest that OS X creates new zpools
using an older version, but is there any way to import a newer
version? Is there any way to &quot;downgrade&quot; the version?

Thanks for the help,

Dave
