<PRE>Thanx for Your contributions, first of all.

These are two nasty limitations for daily usage (which would be
one important use to test it, would it?), if you ask me ;/
I use spotlight a lot, so I couldn't put my home on it.

On the other hand, it would be interesting to see what happens when
using File Vault (provided that it is possible to symlink it to
an encrypted sparse image within a zfs volume). Since zfs snapshots
are block-wise, at least that would be a way to backup the sparse-
monster incrementally - and to have a &quot;portable&quot; time machine.

Of course it would be great for things like the iTunes library,
as well as volumes containing big files such as Paralels VM
images, etc.

Personally, I don't think that this example is one of the most notable
features of zfs (besides you can do this with diskutil as well)...

I've been using zfs on freebsd/amd64 since FreeBSD 7.0-BETA4
and it runs smoothly with appropriate kernel memory settings.
One of my systems receives rsync as well as psyncX backups from
other Unixes and from Macs, and has yet to show any problem.

As for a feature comparison, it looks to me like the Mac OS X
port has implemented more features (ACLs and things like
labels look like they're being kept, at least from a
Finder perspective). I've seen it has problems with resource
forks however (at least when copying recursively with cp).

Finally, I took some more time to read the past posts
on this lists, and have found that No&#235;l Dellofano from inside the
&quot;mothership&quot; is keeping us up to date at a fair pace, and even
posted about a new release shortly.
I look forward to it and will start using zfs on a macbook pro
for the beginning...

Thanx a lot and Regards,


Lorenzo
