<PRE>Hi all! Long-time lurker and always enjoy the good conversations.

I was wondering whether other folks had similar issues with zfs and the 
Finder as well as sharing.

Setup: zfs-111, one pool with 4 filesystems on it (RAIDZ of 4 hard drives)

Through the command line everything is smooth. Through the Finder, 
numerous troubles
- Finder does not recognize the path of the filesystems. E.g., filesystem 
tank/Backups will be shown as an alias in Finder view tank. Once clicking 
on Backups, the listed path just shows tank. Also, none of the filesystems 
can be moved into the Places column (as they are shown as aliases)
- Moving from filesystem to filesystem does not work. Everything gets 
copied fine, but Finder says the items are in use at the source and cannot 
be deleted
- Sharing this pool shows 5 separate shares (as seen from a Macbook): the 
pool tank and each of the 4 file systems as tank1, tank2, ... tank4, not 
the real names of the filesystems (e.g., Backups)

Since this topic has not shown up on the list, am I doing something 
obviously wrong?

Alex
