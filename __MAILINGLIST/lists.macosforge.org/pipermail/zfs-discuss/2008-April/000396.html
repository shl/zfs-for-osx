<PRE>I'll chime in on a similar note.  Aside from the known issues with
having to empty trash by rm'ing and not being able to use spotlight,
it has been good to me on my single-disk MacBook.  I have 60 GB for
applications and boot on HFS+ and 100GB home dir on ZFS, and it has
not given me any panics except for just after getting started with it.
 After some initial stability issues everything seems pretty happy.
I'm even running a bunch of applications out of ~/Applications and
most of those seem fine as well, with the exception that installing
firefox add-ons doesn't seem to work correctly for some reason.

I've been using zetaback (adjusted slightly for my own usage) for
snapshots to one machine, and rsync 3 to another machine for
additional backups, with no real trouble.

Keep in mind that it is case sensitive, as well, and you should be
mostly fine, I think.  I've not lost any data on it aside from things
that haven't been written to disk at the time of panics.  I've not had
any corruption that I know of.

One thing I might stay away from, at the moment, is attaching and
detaching disks a lot from mirrors (like if you want to do something
like this with a memory stick or external drive:

  From my recollection it can be possible to trigger some panics
there.

I'm not sure how I would rate it in comparison to the FreeBSD port.
That one is relatively stable as well, though there are the known
memory issues and some deadlocks there that I don't think I've seen on
OS X.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm looking forward on deploying ZFS fileystems on Mac OS X 10.5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environments (both client and server), as I've already done with Solaris
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and FreeBSD (the latter on development systems).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's no doubt to me that ZFS is a great idea and a huge leap forward in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mac OS X filesystems, and I'm willing to start using zfs on osx (and share
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my experience here) as soon as it gets stable enough for daily usage (ok.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe a tech-aware usage).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since there's nothing on the website about a timeline or a roadmap, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since the current open bugs on trac are anything but encouraging, I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to dare making one question here: is there anybody on this list from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;mothership&quot; allowed to make statements on the progress/current status on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those bugs and on zfs on Mac OS X in general?
