<PRE>Hehe, I'm owner of the list and am from the &quot;mothership&quot; here at  
Apple :)

So I can't make any statements about timelines, roadmaps and things of  
that nature, but if you have specific questions on stuff or bugs I can  
hopefully help you out.  As of right now, I'm concentrating on getting  
snapshot browsing (known as .zfs) up and running, which it is up and  
running, but, um, well less then stable :)  My partner in crime, Don  
Brady, is working on ZFS booting among other things.  We're also  
trying to mow through panics as they come up (we don't have many other  
than ones that all seem to be related to traversing large data  
heirarchies) which we are still trying to nail down.  Things like the  
Finder trash problem are relatively low in the stack, since while  
annoying, is easy to workaround, since &quot;rm -rf .Trash/*&quot;  works just  
fine :)

I use ZFS as my home directory on my laptop that I use everyday  
(ironically to write more ZFS code, how fun!).  I've had no problems  
with it other then like some have mentioned, some apps for Mac expect  
case insensitivity so that breaks some things.  On the whole though,  
I'd give it a go.  If you've got something specific let me know.   
Feedback is always awesome.

apologies as well to the list in general, I try to answer emails as  
much as i can but i'm falling behind :)
