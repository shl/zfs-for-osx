First, Apple, with few very carefully controlled exceptions, does not
talk about future products. ZFS is not currently something they would
build a promotion around, so you aren't going to hear anything
official about it.

Second, Apple does not make public statements unless they are
promotional. Apple's employees occasionally skirt the edges of this,
but unless someone really wants to risk their career, no one in the
know is going to say why Apple doesn't do something.

Third, what benefit would it be to them to do so? Lots of people want
Apple to do things that benefit the person making the request. That's
silly. Apple, the corporation, only acts with self-interest. If you
want something official from Apple, make a _good_ argument about how
it will benefit Apple, and then some Apple employee can try to act on
that.

But you have to be brutally honest with yourself about #3. Sunshine
and good feelings won't cut it. Can you show a specific person or
group that would take specific action that would benefit Apple if they
clarified their ZFS plans?

That said why won't Apple at least update macosforge to the latest released
ZFS code released in the Snow Leopard Server Beta. (For those of us who do
not have a developer acct with beta access?)

Apple could very well benefit from the work that is done here to the code
they open source anyway. (Even if not directly. As witnessed with the
patch.)

I think most of the frustration is that there is no closure. We don't know
if Apple will release anything, we don't know if its worth the investment to
learn. We read the problems, some which have been addressed by later Solaris
ZFS builds and yet over here nothing.

Ok we didn't get it with SL. It didn't kill anyone so no harm, no foul. But
macosforge could have been update with the latest released beta build. A
statement could have been released, we had problems, its gone for now. Or
even better, hang on we'll throw it in a 10.6.x update and update the forge
as soon as we have what we want. (though stuff here doesn't need to be a
final build for us to play with. And heck Apple has a group of very willing
beta testers!)

Personally I waited to see ZFS delivered in SL before trying it because of
the bugs I read about with 119. I ended up trying it anyway to narrow down
an issue I was having with an enclosure and I fell in love with it. I mean
real time feedback on filesystem errors? Self repair? Snapshots? Dude! (And
that's not even scratching the surface.)

Anyway I can respect Apples policy/culture of secrecy. What is frustrating
is the secrecy when its really no necessary.
