<PRE>Thanks to everybody on the list for all your help.  Please put me in
on the new list, and leave me on the old one as long as it runs.

I follow this list, and several other zfs related lists (Nexenta and
Belenix), and I use several zfs capable OS's in office computers.

I've joined the google list, and I'm posting to both lists,
<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">zfs-discuss at lists.macosforge.org</A> and <A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">zfs-macos at googlegroups.com</A>, in
case I miss something from either one in the transition.  Who knows,
maybe they won't yank the macosforge list entirely, or too quickly.  I
think it would be good to at least to document how zfs on mac os x
came to be, and then came not to be.  I don't think its right for
Apple, or anyone else, to change and delete items from their website,
and then pretend it never happened.  When you see a company, group,
government or any kind of organisation using this kind of &quot;memory
hole&quot; technique, you need to call them on it.

&gt;<i>From what I have read on the lists for some time, the speculation
</I>probably is close to the mark, but things may be less complicated or
mysterious than they appear.  Apple's highest profit margins come from
it's gadgets, iPhones and iPods.  Apple also sold more Macs than any
previous quarter - 3.05 million - but the price pressure on computers
is greater, meaning their profit margin on laptops, desktops, etc., is
less than on the gadgets.

Where apple has sold least, and where their profit margin has been
slim or non-existent, has been in the business and enterprise section.
 They seem to have dropped the xserve, and have given their enterprise
business to Promise.  Apple apparently believes that ZFS and os x
server are, largely, business and enterprise products, with little
appeal to their most lucrative market, the retail customer.  So apple
has little incentive to keep and develop enterprise level hardware and
software (xserve, zfs, os x server).

What is unfortunate is that Apple seems able to give this information
in (or it can be easily understood from) their reports to analysts and
investors, but they will not say this to the people who actually buy,
use and want to keep using, their products.  So the best way to
determine what Apple will do is to read the financial information they
give, and also what financial analysts are saying.  And, if you really
want to have a good laugh, ask an Apple rep or employee about
something Apple has already told investors, and watch them deny it, or
claim it never happened, or won't happen.

Do I blame Apple for this?  No.  Do they make great products?  Yes,
they do.  Would I consider them for long term business or enterprise
users, small, large or in between?  Not any more.  Do serious and
successful companies drop an entire line of servers, and then have key
features of an upcoming file system disappear without explanation?
Apparently Apple will be the only one to pull this off, but it is
pretty much unheard of among the Hewlitt Packards, IBM's, Solarises
(Solareses?), and Microsofts.  Would I buy more of their stock?  Sure
I would, just as soon as the price drops back down after the next
correction.  Is it an amazing business model?  You bet, but I'm not
sure they planned to be a mostly retail maker and seller of iPhones
and iPods that sells computers on the side, in their own proprietary
stores.  But, hey, it works for them.

After getting zfs to work on several macs in the office some time ago,
I decided it was sufficiently buggy that I needed a backup.  I mean
that literally.  I needed to move zpools of one version to another,
because the versions on OpenSolaris, FreeBSD and OS X varied over
time.  So I took older, generic machines (any recent intel board with
4 to 8 gigs of memory will do) and set them up as fileservers, running
zfs over cifs (samba).  Of the opensolaris variants, at least 2 keep
fairly up to date with revisions in ZFS:

NexentaCore (the free version of Nexenta)
Belenix

(I don't know how the list handles urls, but you can see the listing
at opensolaris.org, os/downloads/)

The learning curve can be high for these two, and they still have some
kinks.  But they run zfs over samba very well.  Or just use
OpenSolaris.  FreeBSD is also great, and is closer to os x, but the
zpool version lags somewhat compared to opensolaris.

So, yes, by all means, let's try to get zfs better and more stable on
os x, but in the meantime, I would suggest you get another machine
running your zfs pools, and sharing them over samba (or NFS, or
webdav).

It would be great to have time machine working on a zpool.  Some of
the people on this list have probably done it by using a sparse bundle
disk image, and then changing the plist (or whatever apple calls it)
for time machine back ups.  But I would worry about Apple changing or
modifying Time Machine in some way that it won't work with that set up
in future revisions.

So, please, keep up the good work.  I can't help or contribute much to
the 10.6 discussion, because I'm not buying it, or new apple machines,
for the near future.  I'll keep following the list, and if someone is
interested in some of the other zfs capable OS's, I can point them to
sources, and a few &quot;how-to's&quot;.
