Hi David,

yep - we all here licked blood and now try hard to get some more...

On 20.10.2009, at 13:24, David Ritchie wrote:

&gt;<i> So now I'm wondering what to do:-

</I>&gt;<i> 1. If I didn't need to run Mac OS X at all I'd probably just run

</I>
same here... at least for the desktops

&gt;<i> 2. I could set up a file server and access my home directory from  
</I>&gt;<i> it. What would performance be like? Can I get spotlight to work?
</I>
afaik, for spotlight to work on network shares, it has to be supported  
on the
server side (mac os x server does this since 10.5). afaik, netatalk does
not support spotlight yet. so this won't work unless you hack your local
spotlight to index network shares as well, if that's possible at all,  
since
I don't know if the kernel actually produces &quot;file modified&quot; events et  
al
for network shares (i think not)..

&gt;<i> 3. I could have a file server for backup, run my home directory and  
</I>&gt;<i> everything locally on HFS and just use the file server to access  
</I>&gt;<i> backups and snapshots - similar to what I'm doing now but with  
</I>&gt;<i> easier access to snapshots
</I>
I'm doing it like this for a local fileserver: it rsyncs its stuff on  
a sparse
disk image which is located on a FreeBSD-backed ZFS pool and shared to  
the
Mac over NFS (a script mounts the sparse image from the shared volume,
makes the rsync, and detaches it again). The zfs dataset is  
snapshotted daily.
As you can probably imagine, performance **cks, 'cause it's really a  
layering
party - but still viable for nightly backups and way more reliable and  
compatible
than sharing the backup volume itself over NFS. to recover stuff I  
have to export
the .zfs snapshot to another NFS share and mount the image on it. Had  
the case a
few times,  it works without problems, just make sure you wrap it  
around a script
to make it more handy..

&gt;<i> 4. I could carry on as I am, maybe not upgrade to SL yet. Not very  
</I>&gt;<i> convenient access to snapshots (unless I clone every snapshot)
</I>
Dunno about you, but despite it being fairly stable in my experience  
XFS-119 was
far from fast on my (RIP) zfs pools on mac os x...

&gt;<i> 5. I could use iSCSI to mount a ZFS backed disk image and store my  
</I>&gt;<i> home on that. That would give me spotlight and the reliability  
</I>&gt;<i> advantages of ZFS (scrubbing, checksums &amp;c) but not very convenient  
</I>&gt;<i> access to snapshots - it would involve mounting a snapshot to look  
</I>&gt;<i> for stuff I presume
</I>
Since I was curious too, I tried this with a virtualbox running
nexenta and a sparse zvol on it shared over iscsi, formatted and mounted
on the mac.  Actually it surprised me: on a MacBook Pro 2.1GHz it still
copied files  with over 12MB/s sustained data rate - and that was from
virtualbox on the same machine to the mounted zvol and vice-versa.
So that sounds fine, it's just being dependant on an third party  
commercial
iSCSI initiator (i used the GlobalSAN one) that made me back up a
little... but I might be overcareful on that front - still I'd welcome
built-in OSX-iSCSI..

&gt;<i> 6. I could use a ZFS file server for Time machine backups and thus  
</I>&gt;<i> use TM instead of snapshots to get historical data (presumably it  
</I>&gt;<i> would use disk images). Currently I have another disk which TM is  
</I>&gt;<i> backing up to as well.
</I>
I wouldn't do this - after all You're doing the same thing twice here ;)

&gt;<i> So on the whole it might be better, now, to migrate my main file  
</I>&gt;<i> store to another system and access it over GigE, but there just seem  
</I>&gt;<i> to be niggling issues with that. What are other peoples thoughts on  
</I>&gt;<i> this matter? I really like ZFS.
</I>
For that matter, HAMMERfs (dragonflybsd) could even outperform it from  
some
points of view (snapshotting, replication and data retention  
policies)... ;)


Regards,

Lorenzo
