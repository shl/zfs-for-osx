First, Apple, with few very carefully controlled exceptions, does not
talk about future products. ZFS is not currently something they would
build a promotion around, so you aren't going to hear anything
official about it.

Second, Apple does not make public statements unless they are
promotional. Apple's employees occasionally skirt the edges of this,
but unless someone really wants to risk their career, no one in the
know is going to say why Apple doesn't do something.

Third, what benefit would it be to them to do so? Lots of people want
Apple to do things that benefit the person making the request. That's
silly. Apple, the corporation, only acts with self-interest. If you
want something official from Apple, make a _good_ argument about how
it will benefit Apple, and then some Apple employee can try to act on
that.

But you have to be brutally honest with yourself about #3. Sunshine
and good feelings won't cut it. Can you show a specific person or
group that would take specific action that would benefit Apple if they
clarified their ZFS plans?
