<PRE>&gt;<i> First, Apple, with few very carefully controlled exceptions, does not
</I>&gt;<i> talk about future products. ZFS is not currently something they would
</I>&gt;<i> build a promotion around, so you aren't going to hear anything
</I>&gt;<i> official about it.
</I>
Except of course that ZFS isn't &quot;their&quot; project, it's already in use  
in production systems, it was released by Apple for Leopard and as  
part of Snow Leopard builds and they actually *did* promote it as part  
of Snow Leopard Server.  There is no need for the secrecy they'd have  
compared to a new iMac release for instance.

&gt;<i> But you have to be brutally honest with yourself about #3. Sunshine
</I>&gt;<i> and good feelings won't cut it. Can you show a specific person or
</I>&gt;<i> group that would take specific action that would benefit Apple if they
</I>&gt;<i> clarified their ZFS plans?
</I>
Yes: Apple.  We've got a couple of FTSE clients who use Macs and this  
attitude quite seriously makes Apple look pretty amateurish compared  
to Dell, HP or Microsoft etc. when you're dealing with enterprise  
clients.  Large businesses don't like surprises and like to plan  
things, understandably, in advance.  If you're going to buy 500 new  
machines you don't want to do that a month before there's a  
significant price drop or a significant new technology.  You  
definitely, for instance, don't want to start testing a new filesystem  
which Apple say will be released with their latest server OS, only for  
that to disappear without a word from Apple.  Fortunately because  
we're used to things like this we do warn people beforehand not to  
count on a feature until it's officially released, but it doesn't look  
good.  Microsoft, HP and Dell are quite happy to go into businesses  
like this and discuss long-term roadmaps.  We may be used to Apple's  
secrecy, but speak to an enterprise CTO or asset manager about it and  
they literally find it quite hard to believe.

Apple obviously gets benefits from secrecy at the consumer level, but  
what benefit do they get when you're talking about a server technology  
that other systems are already using?  ZFS is more of a &quot;large  
deployment&quot; piece of tech yet Apple are treating it like the next  
update to the iPod nano.  As it is we're getting projects together for  
clients to go into planning for next year's budgets starting in  
April.  We don't know about Apple's plans for next-gen filesystems, so  
storage requirements are being met by Xsan in some cases, other SAN  
solutions or in some cases Solaris systems running ZFS shared out over  
iSCSI.  If we knew what Apple were up to with ZFS could have been a  
basis for some of those storage projects but as it is we're speccing  
alternate servers and systems *not from Apple* instead.  Even if Apple  
come out in 3 months and say &quot;here it is, a first-rate enterprise  
level ZFS solution&quot;, then it's too late; the storage projects will  
already be halfway through budgeting and planning.
