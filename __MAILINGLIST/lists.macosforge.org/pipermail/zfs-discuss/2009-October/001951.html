<PRE>&gt;<i> In my wild-ass opinion, this is likely, although Dominic would  
</I>&gt;<i> undoubtedly be the lead, and he'd be in stealth mode rather than  
</I>&gt;<i> posting on the list; or, perhaps it's a distraction ploy!

It would have been a strange decision to have ZFS in SL server up  
until June and then suddenly decide to build their own from scratch.   
I guess there would be advantages in building their own, especially in  
making it look to apps much more like HFS+ for compatibility, but I  
would have thought it was lots easier just to go with ZFS.  Apple have  
done pretty well with open source recently.

We could always ask Dominic directly, and if he *doesn't* respond,  
perhaps he is working on one.

Or not  :-)
