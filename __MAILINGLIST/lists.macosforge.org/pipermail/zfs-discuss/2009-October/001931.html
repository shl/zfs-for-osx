Thanks for this tip. I now have a great opportunity to test it out, as
I have just aquired a shiny new firewire disk and wish to move a pile
of zfs filesystems with all their snapshots off a usb disk onto the
firewire one.

I have come up with this procedure:

Have two open terminal windows, one labelled the receiver window and
the other the sender window. Run a root shell in both. First, create a
fifo (mkfifo /tmp/zsnap). In the receiver window, run a loop, each
time running  zfs receive TARGET-FS &lt;/tmp/zsnap; sleep 1.

In the sender window, first run  zfs send FIRST-SNAPSHOT &gt;/tmp/zsnap.
When it's done, run

# zfs unmount TARGET-FS
# zfs rollback <A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">TARGET-FS at snapshotname</A>

(otherwise, TARGET-FS tends to get modified, and the next receive will
fail).

Then, in the sender window, run a loop, each time running

  zfs send -i previous-snapshot next-snapshot &amp;&amp; sleep 2


HOWEVER, once in a while, the zfs send command dies at the start with
broken pipe, all without anything untoward happening on the receiver
end. I inserted the sleep commands because they seem to make the
problem less severe, but it still happens. So I actually ended up
making the sender loop more complex still, trying each zfs send
command until it succeeds, up to three times (with a 2 second sleep
between). This seems to work well. I'd post the actual code I use, but
my shell is es, so that would only confuse the readership.


Is the broken pipe problem a known problem in OS X, though?
It seems that fifos just aren't all that reliable.
