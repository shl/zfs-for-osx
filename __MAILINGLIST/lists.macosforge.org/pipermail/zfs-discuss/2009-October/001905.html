<PRE>&gt;<i> Maybe they dropped it as soon as Oracle bought Sun due to weird  
</I>&gt;<i> concerns or maybe and more likely - It just wasn't ready yet.
</I>
Why can't they just come out and say that though?  I can't see a good  
reason for them not to just come out and say &quot;there's licensing  
issues&quot; or &quot;it wasn't ready for primetime&quot;.  It's not like it's a big  
secret special Apple project, it's already in use on Solaris and  
FreeBSD.

&gt;<i> we should either port ZFS &quot;ourselves&quot;,
</I>
The problem being of course is whether the people who *can* continue  
ZFS on OS X are willing to put the time into it when Apple could come  
out in 3 months time and say &quot;you've wasted your time, here's an up to  
date version that we're releasing now that problem x has been  
solved&quot;?  I'm not up on coding filesystems but if someone wants to  
kick it off I can provide server space and other resources.

&gt;<i> continually demand answers from Apple
</I>

That's roughly equivalent to demanding diamonds from a grapefruit and  
equally unlikely to produce a positive result.
