There is a circular queue of 128 uberblocks. For current code,
you can figure on an uberblock update nominally every 30
seconds -- more often if a sync occurs (snapshots cause syncs).

&gt;<i> If you don't walk the entire fs then you run the risk

</I>&gt;<i> in one of the saved uberblocks (which you hopefully did
</I>&gt;<i> not lose by that point).  Then you would lose the changes
</I>&gt;<i> you made recently.
</I>
The risk is that as you become full, some data gets freed
and then overwritten. Not likely on a COW file system until
it gets close to full, but still theoretically possible. The check
is done via scrub, which can take quite some time on TB-sized
file systems.  So the current, manual process is to find a previous
uberblock (easy) and then scrub from that uberblock.  If the
scrub passes, then roll back to the previous uberblock.

&gt;<i> Unless I'm missing something this seems sub-optimal to
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>
I agree. Perhaps it would be a good idea to intentionally not
reuse recently freed blocks, enforced by some policy?  This
would remove the desire to do the scrub and the rollback
is nearly instantaneous.
