Point taken. On the other hand there's ten years of increasingly  
successful examples in community engagement for development in  
between, where you'd hope someone at Apple learned to think  
differently. Since we're talking about ZFS, you can compare what Sun  
did with offering Solaris for Intel ten years ago with what they're  
doing with their development model now, where the latter has done  
something to offset the sense of business risk associated with their  
financial decline. Sure, Sun's been under a lot more pressure to make  
changes than has Apple, but let's not whistle past the graveyard here:  
Apple has some real challenges in maintaining some very complex non- 
mainstream technologies under a fairly conventional proprietary  
development model. It's resisting changes to get away from those kinds  
of self-limiting practices while you're making money that set a  
company up for later problems (e.g. Microsoft).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apple, please reconsider being gracious about how you wind this  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down. So far, you're not showing a sense of community partnership.
