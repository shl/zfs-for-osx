Ouch!

&gt;<i> Minor arguments about my-filesystem-is-better-than-your-filesystem  
</I>&gt;<i> aside, I couldn't go back to a world without snapshots, regardless  
</I>&gt;<i> of the hypothetical benefits of restoring from a crash. But the  
</I>&gt;<i> ability to (incrementally) back up my data to (multiple) hosts on  
</I>&gt;<i> external hard drives which last longer than 17 months and 17 days is  
</I>&gt;<i> something I'm prepared to change server-side OS for if it's not  
</I>&gt;<i> possible to get it on my preferred OS.

Indeed, it's never particularly easy to deal with features being  
removed, especially when other systems can still take advantage of them.

It is the secrecy that's the most irritating though.  This isn't an  
Apple specific project and things like potential licensing/patent  
problems are all out in the open, so what is the benefit of keeping it  
hushed up?  They could come out and say &quot;it's not ready because of x&quot;  
or &quot;we're waiting for the NetApp problem or Oracle merger to be  
sorted&quot; and it would at least answer the questions.  Even &quot;it's gone,  
never coming back&quot; would let everyone know where they stand.

The only thing that would make the secrecy make sense would be:

1.	They're developing their own next-gen filesystem.
2.	They wanted to officially release ZFS along with some hardware to  
take advantage of it, which isn't ready yet.

I'm not convinced that either of those are particularly likely though.
