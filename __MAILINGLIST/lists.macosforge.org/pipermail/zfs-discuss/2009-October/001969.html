<PRE>Hi all,

I've been following this list for some time and I, like many here I'm  
sure, was really hoping that ZFS would be much more usable in SL - at  
least with working Spotlight and .zfs snapshots directory. But alas.  
I've been using ZFS in Leopard for some time now, and on the whole it  
works very well and has been pretty stable since the latest release.

What I'd really like, in an ideal world, is of course to be able to  
boot and root from ZFS on my Mac(s) and have everything work as  
expected. Almost as good as that would be to have my home directory on  
ZFS. I haven't done that because spotlight doesn't work properly,  
which I use a lot.

At the moment I'm running most things on HFS and periodically rsyncing  
my home to the local ZFS pool and snapshotting. Some things - mainly  
VMWare vms - I run straight from the zpool.

I installed SL on my laptop to see what the ZFS support was like, and  
I've managed to get it working by downloading the 119 bits and putting  
in a launchd script to forcibly import the zpool, but this seems  
slightly worrying. Also, even though spotlight was working on the root  
zfs file system it all went a bit wrong - it just kept reindexing all  
the time - so I disabled it. On my laptop my home folder IS on ZFS,  
but that means no spotlight! I don't use the laptop that much though.

With all the uncertainty about the future of ZFS I'm starting to  
wonder about running a file server with Solaris/FreeBSD and storing  
stuff on that. I just set up OpenSolaris on a VM and compiled netatalk  
on it. I can mount the test AFP share just fine and it seems to work -  
I haven't tested performance at all. BUT spotlight doesn't work on it.

So now I'm wondering what to do:-

1. If I didn't need to run Mac OS X at all I'd probably just run  
Solaris or FreeBSD on my machine and be done with it, but I really DO  
want to use Mac OS X

2. I could set up a file server and access my home directory from it.  
What would performance be like? Can I get spotlight to work?

3. I could have a file server for backup, run my home directory and  
everything locally on HFS and just use the file server to access  
backups and snapshots - similar to what I'm doing now but with easier  
access to snapshots

4. I could carry on as I am, maybe not upgrade to SL yet. Not very  
convenient access to snapshots (unless I clone every snapshot)

5. I could use iSCSI to mount a ZFS backed disk image and store my  
home on that. That would give me spotlight and the reliability  
advantages of ZFS (scrubbing, checksums &amp;c) but not very convenient  
access to snapshots - it would involve mounting a snapshot to look for  
stuff I presume

6. I could use a ZFS file server for Time machine backups and thus use  
TM instead of snapshots to get historical data (presumably it would  
use disk images). Currently I have another disk which TM is backing up  
to as well.


So on the whole it might be better, now, to migrate my main file store  
to another system and access it over GigE, but there just seem to be  
niggling issues with that. What are other peoples thoughts on this  
matter? I really like ZFS.


cheers,
-- David

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is correct, FreeBSD 8 (due out soon) will have v13.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I wonder about is, when Mac OS X will finally have a decent
