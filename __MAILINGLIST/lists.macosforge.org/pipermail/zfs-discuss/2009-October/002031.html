<PRE>&gt;<i> They seem to have dropped the xserve, and have given their enterprise

</I>
I think you're getting your hardware confused there, the Xserve is  
very much alive and kicking (and is actually a pretty well specced  
server for the price).

&gt;<i> Do serious and
</I>&gt;<i> successful companies drop an entire line of servers,
</I>
Not a great example seeing as Apple didn't.

&gt;<i> So, yes, by all means, let's try to get zfs better and more stable on
</I>&gt;<i> os x, but in the meantime, I would suggest you get another machine
</I>&gt;<i> running your zfs pools, and sharing them over samba (or NFS, or
</I>&gt;<i> webdav).
</I>
Which is fine if you don't need AFP support, or NetBoot, or the  
ability to easily control MCX settings.  There are some situations  
where Mac OS X Server is by far the best solution; it would just be  
good to have ZFS support.  Switching OS just for a filesystem may work  
in some places, but definitely isn't the complete answer here.

&gt;<i> It would be great to have time machine working on a zpool.
</I>
Not sure why, if you were using ZFS then Time Machine would be an  
entirely pointless exercise, disk image or not.
