<PRE>Hi David-
I experimented with OSX as a ZFS 'host' for some time before I  
eventually decided to go with an OS where ZFS is 'native', so to speak  
- started with OpenSolaris and now I run FreeBSD - and I must say I am  
quite thrilled with the ZFS implementation there.  However, I do use  
OSX as a ZFS 'client' - i.e. talking to my BSD box for backup purposes  
and so on.

My experience with the globalSAN initiator was similar.  I topped out  
at around 1MB/s and no amount of tuning seemed to get me anywhere  
positive.  My subsequent research turned up a lot of information about  
the ZIL, which is the intent log that ZFS keeps around so that it  
knows what it is supposed to be doing.  The consensus seems to be that  
iSCSI (at least the globalSAN implementation of it) makes a lot of  
tiny writes, which involves consulting the intent log many many  
times.  In other words, lots of going to disk to find out what it's  
supposed to be up to.  This is, as you might expect, slow.

The solution(s), as offered up on some of the opensolaris forums, are  
helpful to varying degrees.  You can a) disable ZIL altogether (very  
not recommended), b) put the ZIL on a very fast disk (should be  
fine).  If you want more information, you can search for ZIL, iSCSI,  
and OSX on the opensolaris forums.  Good luck.

</I>&gt;<i> This isn't great. It surprises me a bit, because going from a VMWare

</I>&gt;<i> I got slightly better performance using the MS initiator in Windows

</I>&gt;<i> Still not great.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm beginning to wonder whether it would be quicker to just mount a

</I>&gt;<i> have to write some startup script to hook this all up on boot on the  
</I>&gt;<i> client, and point my home folder to the appropriate place, or mount  
</I>&gt;<i> the image over /Users.
