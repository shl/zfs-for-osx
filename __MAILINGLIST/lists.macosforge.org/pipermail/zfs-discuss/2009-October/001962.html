<PRE>+ Daniel &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/zfs-discuss">nefar at otherware.org</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Am I getting the sense that people are giving up on ZFS on osx?
</I>
Nobody knows what to think, so naturally they jump in different
directions.

&gt;<i> FreeBSD as a community has pulled it off without the backing of a
</I>&gt;<i> company such as Apple, so I'm curious of why the project can't be
</I>&gt;<i> successful just on it's own merit?
</I>
I think the previous discussion has already answered this question,
but I'll try to summarize. First, no project has ever been successful
on its own merit alone. It always takes real people to do the work,
and they have to be motivated enough and have the means to do the
job. Second, it's probably easier to motivate people to develop for a
free OS than for a non-free one, especially if they aren't getting
paid. Third, FreeBSD has a well-functioning community of kernel
developers. There are people writing free software for the Mac (and
some of it is very good), but they write userland code mostly (or even
exclusively?). Fourth, hacking ZFS for OS X probably requires
knowledge of kernel internals that is hard to get if you don't work at
Apple. (Perhaps not impossible, just hard.) I think I'll stop there.
