Certainly something is suspect :-) There were, back in the dim and  
distant past, problems with Oxford FireWire chipsets but those flavour  
of problems were consigned to the 10.1/10.2 days. I've not seen any  
problems with FireWire drives since then. I did see problems with  
cheapo external USB drives. So it's possible that it's the controller/ 
enclosure, but unless you've got a way of testing the drive in  
different enclosures to find out, it's a bit difficult to know.

There's a small possibility that the make/model of your firewire drive/ 
enclosure might help others (Apple?) on this list, though they might  
not want to ask for it in case it gives the game away. If you run  
system_profiler | pbcopy, you'll get a diagnostic of what's on your  
system. Search for FireWire:, which will be the start of your firewire  
drives, and then you can cut out the rest of the stuff in a mail, e.g.  
mine as below. You'll probably want to sanity check it to confirm it  
doesn't have any personally identifiable information in it (it will  
have the GUID of the drive which if you're paranoid, you might want to  
obfuscate) but otherwise it'll be a text file which is similar to the  
data in System Profiler. (You could probably get the info from the  
graphical system profiler and doing a 'copy' on the appropriate bit  
too ... click on 'About this Mac' and then 'More Info' to launch the  
GUI one)
