<PRE>I think there are two distinct problems here: one is that Apple's  
decided to bail on a filesystem far better than HFS+ and the other is  
that the way they've bailed doesn't show a lot of respect for the  
community that did take up the product. I mean, pulling all the code  
and documentation without giving people a chance to make some  
decisions about how to deal with this shows no consideration for those  
who have, understanding that this is something of a skunkworks  
project, accepted the caveats and made use of this. People should  
expect better than to have an announcement made in the first instance  
by way of redirecting attempts to access code, binaries, and  
documentation. This isn't simply a matter of legality: this is telling  
any observer that Apple brooks no compromises between profit and  
property and community-building.

Apple, please reconsider being gracious about how you wind this down.  
So far, you're not showing a sense of community partnership.
