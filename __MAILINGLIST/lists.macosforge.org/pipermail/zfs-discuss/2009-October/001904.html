<PRE>Yeah so to conclude the bittiness of the Kernel is not why Apple  
dropped ZFS. Maybe they dropped it as soon as Oracle bought Sun due to  
weird concerns or maybe and more likely - It just wasn't ready yet.  
Think of all the custom HFS+ features they had to port to ZFS for  
example. Maybe they're even developing their own next generation file  
system - who knows.

Instead of wondering why its not included and why there are no updated  
on macosforge we should either port ZFS &quot;ourselves&quot;, continually  
demand answers from Apple, rant about HFS+ and how lame and horrible  
it is for worlds most advanced operating system and share information.

This is all much more useful than starting a (f)lamewar on a mailing  
list thats almost dead anyway ;)

Kind regards,

John
