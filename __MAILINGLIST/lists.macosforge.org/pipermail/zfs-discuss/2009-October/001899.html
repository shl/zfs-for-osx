</I>Yes, It would. You can't load a 32bit module with a 64bit kernel and 
vice versa.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSolaris has 32bit and 64bit on the same disc, it picks the right

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mac OS is way behind the curve on the 64bit transition, everyone else

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could it be that your knowledge regarding Snow Leopard and its 
</I>&gt;<i> kernel(s) is a bit &quot;behind the curve&quot; here? 
</I>No. Can you elaborate?
If you mean that 10.6 has a 64bit kernel that you can run on some 
machines then I'm aware of that, I've been using it since I got my new 
mbp last month. You could have just said that.

&gt;<i> And, pretty please, although I know this does not belong here, don't 
</I>&gt;<i> try to tell a tech-savvy audience that the Windows 64-bit transition 
</I>&gt;<i> is done. Regarding mass adoption and software offerings, it has not 
</I>&gt;<i> even really started.
</I>Mass adoption and software offerings are a different story. I'm talking 
about the operating system as a package. Though I don't really 
understand what you mean it hasn't even really started? being that a 
large number of people are running 64bit vista or win7 with full 
hardware support and running all the normal software they would run I'd 
say it's more than started. Maybe when XP64 came out it hadn't &quot;even 
really started&quot; but it's 2009 now.

By this logic I guess MacOSX isn't even a real operating system because 
of mass adoption and software offerings? I'll bet you there's more 64bit 
windows systems in the wild than there are macs running 10.5 and 10.6 
combined.
