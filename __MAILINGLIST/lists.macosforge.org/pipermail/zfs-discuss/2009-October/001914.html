<PRE>&gt;<i> If you watch the video that started this thread, you'll see that this
</I>&gt;<i> is one of the upcoming features of ZFS. Basically, they plan to keep a
</I>&gt;<i> backlog of &#252;berblocks so that, if the latest one is no good, you can
</I>&gt;<i> go back and use an earlier one. You'll lose recently written data, of
</I>&gt;<i> course, but your entire pool won't be gone the way it can happen now.
</I>
Indeed, which would be reassuring, except Dominic said:

&quot;Last, I do not believe that the crash protection scheme used
by ZFS can ever work reliably on drives that drop the flush
track cache request.  The only approach that is guaranteed to
work is to keep enough data in a log that when you remount the
drive, you can replay more data than the drive could have kept
cached.&quot;

Obviously Dominic knows a *lot* more about filesystems than I do, so  
if he thinks that the proposed upcoming feature *won't* solve that  
problem then it's both interesting and would possibly explain the  
second thoughts by Apple.  Someone on the mac-osx-server list (I  
initially mistakenly posted my response on the wrong list) mentioned  
the ZIL, but from what I understand I don't think that solves the  
problem either.
