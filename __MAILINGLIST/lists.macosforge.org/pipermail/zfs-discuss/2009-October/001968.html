That is correct, FreeBSD 8 (due out soon) will have v13.
Also, it has just been labeled production ready (the advice
about ZFS being experimental has been removed).
However, ZFS version 13 has been also merged since some time
to FreeBSD 7-STABLE, so if you need it on the 7- branch
just csup/build your system to RELENG_7 and you'll be just fine.

</I>
What I wonder about is, when Mac OS X will finally have a decent
file system? ZFS sure was worth a try (*probably* stopped by
the ORACLE/SUN merger licensing variables), but whatever
replacement will eventually arrive, imo it's really horribly overdue.
Especially after most of the system has been so elegantly optimized for
parallel multitasking.

HFS is really old and has some serious performance and reliability
drawbacks (the most famous being the Catalog File, which has to
be contended by any task updating the filesystem structure[1]).
Almost all spinning wheels I see on SL are related to
file system / volume handling.

I'm no Linu[xs] fan, but I think Linus Torvalds has a point with his
comments on HFS... [2]

Cheers,


Lorenzo
