<PRE>I'm not entirely sure why this behavior by Apple is surprising. This  
is how they've handled many of their &quot;skunkworks&quot; projects. I  
distinctly remember MkLinux having a very similar cycle - being  
dropped suspiciously and with little word and then all of a sudden Mac  
OS X Beta appearing with a very similar MACH kernel base except with a  
better userland.

While it may be painful in the short term, I think the long term  
results will yield something surprising and amazing.

At least that's my hope.

I appreciate all the work/help everyone has done to make this project  
happen - I hope to see you on the &quot;flip side&quot; of ZFS.
