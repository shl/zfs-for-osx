It was never publicly released. It was only available under NDA in  
binary form; whoever leaked it and made it available has done so  
without Apple's consent. I don't support using it, even if Apple has  
publicly given up on thus project.

Word has it that the 119 bits work; I made a download available from  
my blog and some tutorials there. The instructions on the wiki still  
apply.

&gt;<i>  I'm considering moving from my FreeBSD server to osx, but as I have

Don't move on to OSX Server - stay on FreeBSD. You're likely to get  
much better ongoing ZFS performance there: in addition, it wouldn't  
surprise me if the version that the 119 bits are capable of reading  
(8) is lower than the support in FreeBSD anyway, which means your pool  
may not even be loadable.

There is really very little to recommend OSX as a server over ant  
other OS mow (well, perhaps except Windows, but anyone who uses  
Windows as a server deserves whatever they get anyway). Many people I  
know have interpreted the lack of anything on this project as implying  
the death of ZFS on OSX to the extent that server installs are moving  
away from OSX and onto more reliable systems like FreeBSD. In any  
case, there's really nothing that OSX server can do that any other  
Unix box can do, and quite a lot it can't.
