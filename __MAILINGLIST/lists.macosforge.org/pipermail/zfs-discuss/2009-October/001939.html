It is not clear that any such filesystem exists.

&gt;<i> Obviously for a company in Sun's position, where the hardware is  
</I>&gt;<i> generally a higher spec, and the admins are more likely to be  
</I>&gt;<i> specifically trained, it's probably a lesser problem.  You have to  
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if this *is* the reason Apple pulled ZFS, you get a lot of  
</I>&gt;<i> Apple admins who do the admin side as a second job to being a  
</I>&gt;<i> teacher/studio manager etc., and they're probably much more likely  
</I>&gt;<i> to hook up a USB/Firewire drive to an Xserve as storage than your  
</I>&gt;<i> average Solaris admin.
</I>
No, because the issue applies equally to journaling filesystems (like  
HFS+).

&gt;<i>  Perhaps Apple decided they needed a better level of pool recovery

</I>&gt;<i> pitchforks and flaming torches I doubt we'll find out soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Saying that, if someone wants to get some flaming torches sorted, I
