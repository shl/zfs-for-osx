</I>I understand this.

What I don't understand is how you know whether there is
damage to the most recent txtag without actually walking
the entire file system?  Even if the uberblock checksum is
ok, there may be damage elsewhere in the pool.

If you just start using the pool represented by latest
valid txtag and then later find damage, what do you do?
Which txtag do you roll back to?  There's nothing that says
the previous txtag is any more valid than the one you used.
Further, how do you apply the changes you made since you
mounted to the previous pool?  Further still, if it takes
you a while to discover the damage and you make a lot of
changes, you may have recycled through those 128 uberblocks
already.

On drives that do not honor flush-track-cache, unless you
do a complete file system walk at mount time I don't see how
you can know if a particular txtag is valid or not.  Please
educate me if I'm missing something.

</I>Actually I disagree: if your log contains more data than
the drive could have buffered then you're safe.  That's why
we let the active journal grow very large on HFS (on a big
drive it may be 10's of megabytes or more).  If a drive has
a 16 meg cache and you've got 20 megs worth of data to
replay then you will undo any damage the drive could have
done.
