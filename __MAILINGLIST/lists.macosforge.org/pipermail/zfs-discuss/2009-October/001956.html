We have two data centers, each with (formerly) 5x XServe RAIDs serving  
purely as MySQL storage DAS boxes over fibre channel.  Right after the  
Promise Boxes came out we upgraded one to Promise SAS boxes, but we  
had been waiting for Snow Leopard and ZFS to consider what to do next.

When ZFS disappeared we got a Sun 7410 on try and buy and connected it  
to our XServes via NFS.  It was faster than the Promise boxes (for our  
internal MySQL benchmark scripts and sysbench) and so far it has  
sustained that speed advantage with 5 MySQL servers all accessing the  
same pool.  With that many servers (and Sun's discounting even to  
small customers...you should get a price quote) it is cheaper than the  
Promise boxes, faster and you get all the ZFS benefits for free.

While we were at it we got a Sun x2270 instead of XServes to try as  
MySQL heads.  Those were just as easy and cheaper after the discount  
(we got the x2270 with 48 GB RAM for less than we could get the XServe  
with 24 GB RAM).  That got us looking at VMWare and we started  
migrating things to VMs on ESXi (storage on the 7410) rather than  
hosting them on XServes.

So I'll admit we aren't a core market for Apple, and we aren't very  
big, but we formerly had 10x XServes with MySQL, 2-4 XServes for other  
things and 10x Apple DAS boxes which are now going to wind up 10-20x  
x2270s (MySQL and ESXi) and 2x 7410s.  We are very happy with it after  
five months.

I think your point is correct, but I do think in some cases Apple has  
hurt itself.  For some customers there are alternatives, and waiting  
for an unspecified (possibly infinite) time for Apple to match them  
isn't realistic.
