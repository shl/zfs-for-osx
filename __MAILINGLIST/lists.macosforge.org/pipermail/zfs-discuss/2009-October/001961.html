<PRE>Am I getting the sense that people are giving up on ZFS  on osx?  FreeBSD as
a community has pulled it off without the backing of a company such as
Apple, so I'm curious of why the project can't be successful just on it's
own merit?

</I>&gt;<i> extent that server installs are moving away from OSX and onto more reliable
</I>&gt;<i> systems like FreeBSD. In any case, there's really nothing that OSX server
</I>&gt;<i> can do that any other Unix box can do, and quite a lot it can't.
