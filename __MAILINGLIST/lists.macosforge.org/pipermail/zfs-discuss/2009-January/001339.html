<PRE>Hi list,
I use an Mac-mini and a couple of USB-enclosures for my data-storage  
needs.
due to cabling problems, (and due to the fact I don't want a couple of  
humming HDs in my living-room) I can currently only use USB for my  
data transfer.

I don't mind (very much) that the transfer speed is not too high, i  
just need a cheap and reliable solution. (Cheap should also apply to  
the cost of electricity.)

Until recently this has worked reasonably well, but somehow the  
combination of a particular enclosure with my relatively new WD 1GB  
GreenLine disk has produced a number of problems.

ZFS is generally quite robust in a mirrored configuration, but leaves  
one in the complete cold when it cannot make sense out of the main  
ueberblocks (or disk labels). As I have understood, it should be  
relatively easy to write a tool that gets date from the latest  
snapshot if the main ueberblock gets damaged afterwards, but to my  
knowledge such a tool has not been written yet (That could be zfs list/ 
send applied to a non-importable pool.)

Another odd problem I have is a damaged partition map on my WD drive.

</I>&gt;<i> disk2s2
</I>&gt;<i> bertlinge:~ Susalf$
</I>Somehow diskutil does not recognize most of my partitions while ZFS is  
merrily accessing at least one of my &quot;invisible&quot; partitions.
The point is, I would really like to get some date from an HFS+  
partition on that drive and from another damaged ZFS pool that is  
currently non-importable.
Now it looks a bit like all the redundant blocks in ZFS are of little  
help when you can still have a single point of failure in your  
partition map.

 From what I had read, I suspected the Mac port would use diskutil to  
search for ZFS partitions, but this seems to be not entirely correct.
1. Is there a recommended way to try mounting and/or repairing the  
partitions.
2. What data would need to save do some external non-volatile storage  
to be able to repair the partition-map on a GUID-disk
3. Whats the easiest way to re-import get the data from a broken ZFS- 
Volume.
4. Are there any firmware patches or settings that force testing the  
data written to a USB-device has actually been written to the disk? (I  
mean, no matter how superior FireWire is, its just binary data, so its  
either there or not. It should be possible to get it where it belongs,  
even if its slower than it could/should be).
5. Since some enclosures work very well, can anyone point me to the  
right ones or are there good test utilities, so I can be reasonably  
sure before I move my data onto them?
6. (Probably this list is the wrong place to ask this). I've got some  
old server hardware and want to build a file-/backup server on it,  
preferably deploying ZFS.
Obviously, I want to access it from a Mac, other potential users will  
likely use Windows or Linux. Can anyone point me to good how-tos or  
recommendations  on disk-controllers and solaris vs. Linux vs. FreeBsd  
vs. Darwin as a Server OS. (This really has to be cheap, so I cannot  
make investments on Hard- or Software.

Thanks,	
	ralf
