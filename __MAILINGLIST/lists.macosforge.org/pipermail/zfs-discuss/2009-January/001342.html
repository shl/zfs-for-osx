Maybe I'm a little bit naiive - but I do actually await a
leopard (10.5.x) merge spearheaded by the Apple team, if ZFS on
the mac is to be adopted widely (be it only in the server arena
at first) once SL is released. I'd like to know that I don't have
to update every single client just to be able to access zfs media
in the future. I can understand that there will be no support for
Tiger - but even taking into account a few drawbacks, I'd like to
see zfs debugged working with Leopard. Even if that means waiting
for 10.5.7, 10.5.8 or something to have the most important
changes done in the kernel. Well, OK, maybe I'm just dreaming, but
I started using these feeds in the hope that there will be
ongoing development (which was the case until ... now).
Not merging any of the good work done now is not really the
behavior of a &quot;first class citizen&quot; in the open source community...

Regards,


Lorenzo
