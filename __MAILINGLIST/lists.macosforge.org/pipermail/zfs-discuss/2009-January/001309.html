<PRE>It does it because Sun created it and that's what Sun said it SHOULD  
DO when data integrity cannot be guaranteed. So that's what Apple's  
port does too. Sun later changed their mind and made it an option but  
that hasn't been ported yet. They're working on it.

As for ZFS being designed to tolerate device failure, you're a little  
off in your expectations. Bad sectors will be tolerated as you say,  
but a total device failure will only be tolerated if you're running a  
mirrored or raidz pool. If you've just got straight disks and one  
completely dies you're screwed.

The problem is that unplugging an external drive looks like a total  
failure to the current port. A better solution, which Apple has said  
they're looking at, is to recognize that it was removed and not dead  
and possibly pause the filesystem and prompt you to plug it back in.  
But that won't happen in Leopard because it doesn't have the kernel  
hook they'd need, but possibly in Snow Leopard.

I hope this helps clarify things.

P.S. I don't think Sun ever really envisioned ZFS being used on USB or  
Firewire drives. Certainly not in a non mirrored or raidz setup. :)
