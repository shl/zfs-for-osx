<PRE>Hi There,

I've just installed the latest ZFS bits and pieces on my MacPro  
running 10.5.1.

When creating a zpool, I've come across an interesting anomaly.

I used the following commands:

diskutil partitiondisk /dev/disk8 GPTFormat ZFS %noformat% 100%
zpool create USB250GB /dev/disk8s2

I then did a 'zpool scrub', followed by 'zpool status', and see the  
following:

bash-3.2# zpool status
   pool: USB250GB
  state: ONLINE
status: The pool is formatted using an older on-disk format.  The pool  
can
	still be used, but some features are unavailable.
action: Upgrade the pool using 'zpool upgrade'.  Once this is done, the
	pool will no longer be accessible on older software versions.
  scrub: scrub completed with 0 errors on Thu Jan 10 09:17:17 2008
config:

	NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
	USB250GB    ONLINE       0     0     0
	  disk8s2   ONLINE       0     0     0

This prompted me to do a 'zpool upgrade', which shows the following:

bash-3.2# zpool upgrade
This system is currently running ZFS pool version 8.

The following pools are out of date, and can be upgraded.  After being
upgraded, these pools will no longer be accessible by older software  
versions.

VER  POOL
---  ------------
  6   USB250GB

Use 'zpool upgrade -v' for a list of available versions and their  
associated
features.


It seems that 'zpool create' is building a pool using an older pool  
version than
the system supports. I've tried the same thing under the latest build  
of Nevada
(build 80), and this doesn't happen.

The pool can be successfully upgraded to version 8, and everything works
fine afterwards.

I've checked that I'm using the correct zpool binary, and I am.

It's not really a bug, but it's also not expected behaviour.

Regards,

Andy.
