Subject: [Zfs-dev] zpool creates pools with mismatched zpool version
Message-ID: <2F01EE93-0425-448A-8129-672F8BDBC0DD@sun.com>

Hi There,

I've just installed the latest ZFS bits and pieces on my MacPro  
running 10.5.1.

When creating a zpool, I've come across an interesting anomaly.

I used the following commands:

diskutil partitiondisk /dev/disk8 GPTFormat ZFS %noformat% 100%
zpool create USB250GB /dev/disk8s2

I then did a 'zpool scrub', followed by 'zpool status', and see the  
following:

bash-3.2# zpool status
   pool: USB250GB
  state: ONLINE
status: The pool is formatted using an older on-disk format.  The pool  
can
	still be used, but some features are unavailable.
action: Upgrade the pool using 'zpool upgrade'.  Once this is done, the
	pool will no longer be accessible on older software versions.
  scrub: scrub completed with 0 errors on Thu Jan 10 09:17:17 2008
config:

	NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
	USB250GB    ONLINE       0     0     0
	  disk8s2   ONLINE       0     0     0

This prompted me to do a 'zpool upgrade', which shows the following:

bash-3.2# zpool upgrade
This system is currently running ZFS pool version 8.

The following pools are out of date, and can be upgraded.  After being
upgraded, these pools will no longer be accessible by older software  
versions.

VER  POOL
---  ------------
  6   USB250GB

Use 'zpool upgrade -v' for a list of available versions and their  
associated
features.


It seems that 'zpool create' is building a pool using an older pool  
version than
the system supports. I've tried the same thing under the latest build  
of Nevada
(build 80), and this doesn't happen.

The pool can be successfully upgraded to version 8, and everything works
fine afterwards.

I've checked that I'm using the correct zpool binary, and I am.

It's not really a bug, but it's also not expected behaviour.

Regards,

Andy.

Hey Andy,

Yeah sorry, this is confusing and weird but there is explanation :)  
We're forcing version 6 creation for backward compatibility.
Basically this is an artifact of the fact that though the Mac ZFS bits  
now synced with Solaris SNV Build 72, which is ZFS on disk version 8,  
we (Mac OSX ZFS) still create version 6 pools for compatibility with  
the ZFS readonly version which was released with Leopard(which was SNV  
build 61 and thus is version 6). The two on disk format changes that  
were added don?t actually add any new features to ZFS on OSX yet  
(delegated administration and separate intent logs aren?t enabled) so  
we don't lose any new features because of the version change. Since  
the read only version of ZFS released with Leopard was only at ZFS on  
disk version 6, we didn?t want to introduce a ZFS write-able version  
that would be incompatible. Hence, new pools are getting created as  
version 6, and zfs version 1, so that you can use your pools on  
systems with the original Leopard zfs readonly bits, and also on  
systems you have the new writeable ZFS bits installed.  This is why  
zpool status is telling you your pool is out of date.

Never fear, we will update the pool creation to use version 8 (and zfs  
version 2) as soon as we can release updated zfs readonly bits in a  
Leopard Software Update.

I'll add this to the ZFS FAQ on a new webpage I'm creating for us to  
save on confusion, since I'm sure other people will have questions on  
this too.

thanks for using ZFS!

Noel :)
