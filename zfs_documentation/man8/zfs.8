.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBzfs\fR command configures ZFS datasets within a ZFS storage pool, as described in \fBzpool\fR(8). A
dataset is identified by a unique path within the ZFS namespace. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
pool/{filesystem,volume,snapshot}
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
where the maximum length of a dataset name is \fBMAXNAMELEN\fR (256 bytes).
.LP
A dataset can be one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIfile system\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
A standard POSIX file system. ZFS file systems can be mounted within the standard file system namespace and behave like any other file system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIvolume\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
A logical volume exported as a raw or block device. This type of dataset should only be used under special circumstances. File systems are typically used in most environments.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fIsnapshot\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt  
A read-only version of a file system or volume at a given point in time. It is specified as \fIfilesystem@name\fR or \fIvolume@name\fR.
.RE

.SS ZFS Read-only Implementation
ZFS on OSX is implemented as a readonly filesystem by default.  This means that only the ZFS subcommands that do non write operations are permitted. Permitted subcommands are \fBlist\fR, \fBget\fR, \fBmount\fR, \fBunmount\fR, and \fBsend\fR.
.LP
A full ZFS implementation that allows all subcommands and is read/write is available for download at http://developer.apple.com/.
.LP
To determine which version of ZFS is loaded(readonly or writable):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB# kextstat | grep zfs \fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
com.apple.filesystems.zfs.readonly is the readonly kext version.
com.apple.filesystems.zfs is the writable kext version.

.SS "ZFS File System Hierarchy"
.LP
A ZFS storage pool is a logical collection of devices that provide space for datasets. A storage pool is also the root of the ZFS file system hierarchy.
.LP
The root of the pool can be accessed as a file system, such as mounting and unmounting, taking snapshots, and setting properties. The physical storage characteristics, however, are managed by the \fBzpool\fR(8) command.
.LP
See \fBzpool\fR(8) for more information on creating and administering pools.
.SS "Snapshots"
.LP
A snapshot is a read-only copy of a file system or volume. Snapshots can be created extremely quickly, and initially consume no additional space within the pool. As data within the active dataset changes, the snapshot consumes more data than would otherwise be shared with the active dataset.
.LP
Snapshots can have arbitrary names. Snapshots of volumes can be cloned or rolled back, but cannot be accessed independently.
.LP
File system snapshots can be accessed under the ".zfs/snapshot" directory in the root of the file system. Snapshots are automatically mounted on demand and may be unmounted at regular intervals. The visibility of the ".zfs" directory can be controlled by the "snapdir"
property.
.SS "Clones"
.LP
A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial contents are the same as another dataset. As with snapshots, creating a clone is nearly instantaneous, and initially consumes no additional space.
.LP
Clones can only be created from a snapshot. When a snapshot is cloned, it creates an implicit dependency between the parent and child. Even though the clone is created somewhere else in the dataset hierarchy, the original snapshot cannot be destroyed as long as a clone exists. The "origin"
property exposes this dependency, and the \fBdestroy\fR command lists any such dependencies, if they exist.
.LP
The clone parent-child dependency relationship can be reversed by using the "\fBpromote\fR" subcommand. This causes the "origin" file system to become a clone of the specified file system, which makes it possible to destroy the file system that the clone
was created from.
.SS "Mount Points"
.LP
Creating a ZFS file system is a simple operation, so the number of file systems per system will likely be numerous. To cope with this, ZFS automatically manages mounting and unmounting file systems.
All automatically managed file systems are mounted by ZFS at boot time.
.LP
By default, file systems are mounted under /Volumes/fs, where fs is the name of the file system in the ZFS namespace. Directories are created and destroyed as needed.
.LP
A file system can also have a mount point set in the "mountpoint" property. This directory is created as needed, and ZFS automatically mounts the file system when the "\fBzfs mount -a\fR" command is invoked. The mountpoint property can be inherited, so if \fBVolumes/pool/home\fR has a mount point of \fB/export/stuff\fR, then \fBpool/home/user\fR automatically inherits a mount point of \fB/export/stuff/user\fR.
.LP
A file system mountpoint property of "none" prevents the file system from being mounted.
.LP
If needed, ZFS file systems can also be managed with traditional tools (\fBmount\fR, \fBumount\fR). If a file system's mount point is set to "legacy", ZFS makes no attempt to manage
the file system, and the administrator is responsible for mounting and unmounting the file system.
.SS "Native Properties"
.LP
Properties are divided into two types, native properties and user defined properties. Native properties either export internal statistics or control ZFS behavior. In addition, native properties are either editable or read-only. User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior,
but you can use them to annotate datasets in a way that is meaningful in your environment. For more information about user properties, see the "User Properties" section.
.LP
Every dataset has a set of properties that export statistics about the dataset as well as control various behavior. Properties are inherited from the parent unless overridden by the child. Snapshot properties can not be edited; they always inherit their inheritable properties. Properties
that are not applicable to snapshots are not displayed.
.LP
The values of numeric properties can be specified using the following human-readable suffixes (for example, "k", "KB", "M", "Gb", etc, up to Z for zettabyte). The following are all valid (and equal) specifications: 
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"1536M", "1.5g", "1.50GB".
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
The values of non-numeric properties are case sensitive and must be lowercase, except for "mountpoint" and "sharenfs".
.LP
The first set of properties consist of read-only statistics about the dataset. These properties cannot be set, nor are they inherited. Native properties apply to all dataset types unless otherwise noted.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBtype\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
The type of dataset: "filesystem", "volume", "snapshot", or "clone".
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBcreation\fR

.rt  
The time this dataset was created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBused\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
The amount of space consumed by this dataset and all its descendants. This is the value that is checked against this dataset's quota and reservation. The space used does not include this dataset's reservation, but does take into account the reservations of any descendant datasets.
The amount of space that a dataset consumes from its parent, as well as the amount of space that will be freed if this dataset is recursively destroyed, is the greater of its space used and its reservation.
.sp
When snapshots (see the "Snapshots" section) are created, their space is initially shared between the snapshot and the file system, and possibly with previous snapshots. As the file system changes, space that was previously shared becomes unique to the snapshot, and counted in
the snapshot's space used. Additionally, deleting snapshots can increase the amount of space unique to (and used by) other snapshots.
.sp
The amount of space used, available, or referenced does not take into account pending changes. Pending changes are generally accounted for within a few seconds. Committing a change to a disk using \fBfsync\fR(3c) or \fBO_SYNC\fR does not necessarily guarantee that the space usage information is updated immediately.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBavailable\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
The amount of space available to the dataset and all its children, assuming that there is no other activity in the pool. Because space is shared within a pool, availability can be limited by any number of factors, including physical pool size, quotas, reservations, or other datasets
within the pool.
.sp
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, "avail".
.RE

.sp

.mk
.na
\fBreferenced\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
.rt  
The amount of data that is accessible by this dataset, which may or may not be shared with other datasets in the pool. When a snapshot or clone is created, it initially references the same amount of space as the file system or snapshot it was created from, since its contents are
identical.
.sp
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, "refer".

.RS 17n
.rt  
For cloned file systems or volumes, the snapshot from which the clone was created. The origin cannot be destroyed (even with the \fB-r\fR or \fB-f\fR options) so long as a clone exists.
.RE

.LP
The following two properties can be set to control the way space is allocated between datasets. These properties are not inherited, but do affect their descendants.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBquota=\fIsize\fR | \fInone\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Limits the amount of space a dataset and its descendants can consume. This property enforces a hard limit on the amount of space used. This includes all space consumed by descendants, including file systems and snapshots. Setting a quota on a descendant of a dataset that already
has a quota does not override the ancestor's quota, but rather imposes an additional limit.
.sp
Quotas cannot be set on volumes, as the "volsize" property acts as an implicit quota.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBreservation=\fIsize\fR | \fInone\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The minimum amount of space guaranteed to a dataset and its descendants. When the amount of space used is below this value, the dataset is treated as if it were taking up the amount of space specified by its reservation. Reservations are accounted for in the parent datasets' space
used, and count against the parent datasets' quotas and reservations.
.sp
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, "reserv".

\fBrecordsize=\fIsize\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies a suggested block size for files in the file system. This property is designed solely for use with database workloads that access files in fixed-size records. \fBZFS\fR automatically tunes block sizes according to internal algorithms optimized for typical
access patterns. 
.sp
For databases that create very large files but access them in small random chunks, these algorithms may be suboptimal. Specifying a "recordsize" greater than or equal to the record size of the database can result in significant performance gains. Use of this property for general
purpose file systems is strongly discouraged, and may adversely affect performance.
.sp
The size specified must be a power of two greater than or equal to 512 and less than or equal to 128 Kbytes.
.sp
Changing the file system's \fBrecordsize\fR only affects files created afterward; existing files are unaffected.

This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, "recsize".

Controls the mount point used for this file system. See the "Mount Points" section for more information on how this property is used. 
.sp
When the mountpoint property is changed for a file system, the file system and any children that inherit the mount point are unmounted. If the new value is "legacy", then they remain unmounted. Otherwise, they are automatically remounted in the new location if the property was
previously "legacy" or "none", or if they were mounted before the property was changed. In addition, any shared file systems are unshared and shared in the new location.

.sp
.ne 2

\fBsharenfs=\fIon\fR | \fIoff\fR | \fIopts\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Controls whether the file system is shared via \fBNFS\fR, and what options are used. A file system with a sharenfs property of "off" is managed through traditional tools such as \fBshare\fR(1M), \fBunshare\fR(1M), and \fBdfstab\fR(4). Otherwise, the file system is automatically shared and unshared with the "\fBzfs share\fR" and "\fBzfs unshare\fR" commands. If the property is set to "on", the \fBshare\fR(1M) command is invoked with no options. Otherwise, the \fBshare\fR(1M) command is invoked with options equivalent to the contents of this property.
.sp
When the "sharenfs" property is changed for a dataset, the dataset and any children inheriting the property are re-shared with the new options, only if the property was previously "off", or if they were shared before the property was changed. If the new property is "off",
the file systems are unshared.

.RS 4n
Controls the compression algorithm used for this dataset. The "lzjb" compression algorithm is optimized for performance while providing decent data compression. Setting compression to "on" uses the "lzjb" compression algorithm. The "gzip" compression algorithm is not yet supported for OSX.  The "gzip"
compression algorithm uses the same compression as the \fBgzip\fR(1) command.  You can specify the "gzip" level by using the value "gzip-\fIN\fR",
where \fIN\fR is an integer from 1 (fastest) to 9 (best compression ratio). Currently, "gzip" is equivalent to "gzip-6" (which is also the default for \fBgzip\fR(1)).

bits, unless it is a user entry that has the same \fBUID\fR as the owner of the file or directory. In this case, the \fBACL\fR permissions are reduced so that they are no greater than owner permission bits.

.SS "Temporary Mount Point Properties"
.LP
When a file system is mounted, either through \fBmount\fR(1M) for legacy mounts or the "\fBzfs mount\fR" command for normal file systems,
its mount options are set according to its properties. The correlation between properties and mount options is as follows:
.sp
.in +2

    PROPERTY                MOUNT OPTION
    devices                 devices/nodevices

.LP
In addition, these options can be set on a per-mount basis using the \fB-o\fR option, without affecting the property that is stored on disk. The values specified on the command line override the values stored in the dataset. The \fB-nosuid\fR option is an alias for "nodevices,nosetuid".
These properties are reported as "temporary" by the "\fBzfs get\fR" command. If the properties are changed while the dataset is mounted, the new setting overrides any temporary settings.
.SS "User Properties"

In addition to the standard native properties, ZFS supports arbitrary user properties. User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but applications or administrators can use them to annotate datasets.

User property names must contain a colon (":") character, to distinguish them from native properties. They might contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctuation characters: colon (":"), dash ("-"), period ("."), and underscore
("_"). The expected convention is that the property name is divided into two portions such as "\fImodule\fR:\fIproperty\fR", but this namespace is not enforced by \fBZFS\fR. User property names can be at most 256 characters,
and cannot begin with a dash ("-").
.LP
When making programmatic use of user properties, it is strongly suggested to use a reversed \fBDNS\fR domain name for the \fImodule\fR component of property names to reduce the chance that two independently-developed packages use the same property name for
different purposes. Property names beginning with "com.apple." are reserved for use by Apple Inc.
.LP
The values of user properties are arbitrary strings, are always inherited, and are never validated. All of the commands that operate on properties ("zfs list", "zfs get", "zfs set", etc.) can be used to manipulate both native properties and user properties.
Use the "\fBzfs inherit\fR" command to clear a user property . If the property is not defined in any parent dataset, it is removed entirely. Property values are limited to 1024 characters.
.SS "Volumes as Swap or Dump Devices"
.LP
To set up a swap area, create a \fBZFS\fR volume of a specific size and then enable swap on that device. For more information, see the EXAMPLES section.
.LP
Do not swap to a file on a \fBZFS\fR file system. A \fBZFS\fR swap file configuration is not supported.
.LP
Using a \fBZFS\fR volume as a dump device is not supported.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.LP
All subcommands that modify state are logged persistently to the pool in their original form.

.sp
The snaphot that was cloned, and any snapshots previous to this snapshot, are now owned by the promoted clone. The space they use moves from the "origin" file system to the promoted clone, so enough space must be available to accommodate these snapshots. No new space is consumed
by this operation, but the space accounting is adjusted. The promoted clone must not have any conflicting snapshot names of its own. The "\fBrename\fR" subcommand can be used to rename any conflicting snapshots.

The following commands illustrate how to test out changes to a file system, and then replace the original file system with the changed one, using clones, clone promotion, and renaming:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB# zfs create pool/project/production\fR
 populate /pool/project/production with data
\fB# zfs snapshot pool/project/production@today
# zfs clone pool/project/production@today pool/project/beta\fR
 make changes to /pool/project/beta and test them
\fB# zfs promote pool/project/beta
# zfs rename pool/project/production pool/project/legacy
# zfs rename pool/project/beta pool/project/production\fR
 once the legacy version is no longer needed, it can be
 destroyed

\fBExample 12 \fR Replicating ZFS Data
.LP
The following commands send a full stream and then an incremental stream to respective backup files, restoring them into "\fBpoolB/received/fs\fR@a" and "\fBpoolB/received/fs@b\fR", respectively. "\fBpoolB\fR" must contain
the file system "\fBpoolB/received\fR", and must not initially contain "\fBpoolB/received/fs\fR".

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# zfs send pool/fs@a > /tmp/backup_full \e
# zfs receive poolB/received/fs@a < /tmp/backup_full
# zfs send -i a pool/fs@b > /tmp/backup.today \e
# zfs receive poolB/received/fs < /tmp/backup.today

\fBExample 13 \fRUsing the  zfs receive -d Option
.LP
The following command sends a full stream of "\fBpoolA/fsA/fsB@snap\fR" to a backup file, receiving it into "\fBpoolB/received/fsA/fsB@snap\fR". The "\fBfsA/fsB@snap\fR" portion of the received snapshot's name
is determined from the name of the sent snapshot. "\fBpoolB\fR" must contain the file system "\fBpoolB/received\fR".  If  "\fBpoolB/received/fsA\fR" does not exist, it will be created as an empty file system.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB# zfs send poolA/fsA/fsB@snap > /tmp/backup.fsB \e
   # zfs receive -d poolB/received < /tmp/backup.fsB
